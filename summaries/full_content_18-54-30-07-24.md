# AMD denies reports of Ryzen 5000XT launch delay &mdash; chips on schedule for release this month

[Tomshardware US](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-denies-reports-of-ryzen-5000xt-launch-delay-chipmaker-says-chips-on-schedule-for-release-tomorrow)

Despite media reports that AMD has delayed its Ryzen 5000XT processors, AMD told Tom's Hardware that the Ryzen 9 5900XT and the Ryzen 7 5800XT will launch as scheduled. The chipmaker had previously slated the 5000XT launch for July, meaning the chips should be available at retail tomorrow."There has been no change to the sales embargo of the 5000XT," an AMD representative confirmed to Tom's Hardware.Fueled by an updated product listing at B&H Photo Video, several media outlets reported today that AMD's Ryzen 5000XT had been delayed. The retailer moved the pre-order launch dates of the Ryzen 9 5900XT and the Ryzen 7 5800XT to August 15 and August 8, respectively, which is 15 days after AMD's target launch date in July. However, AMD has confirmed that this isn't the case.B&H Photo's delayed pre-order times led to reports that AMD would delay the launch of its Ryzen 5000XT processors, just like what happened to the Ryzen 9000 chips due to quality issues. A branding typo could have contributed to the delay for the Ryzen 9000 chips, but it isn't clear if that is the only underlying issue. In either case, AMD is pulling back the Ryzen 9000 chips in its supply chain to re-screen them for unspecified quality issue(s). AMD will now launch the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X processors on August 8. The higher-end Ryzen 9 9950X and Ryzen 9 9900X will be delayed until August 15.   There are a few possibilities for the sudden change to B&H Photo Video's pre-order listings. For instance, the Ryzen 9 5900XT and the Ryzen 7 5800XT listings could simply be placeholders, which is common with foreign retailers whose pricing and dates don't always match the official information. Or perhaps the person revising the listing mistakenly used the same launch date as the Ryzen 9000 series.As a quick recap, the Ryzen 7 5800XT is an almost identical twin to the Ryzen 7 5800X, featuring eight Zen 3 cores, 32MB of L3 cache, and a 105W TDP. AMD's only change to the Ryzen 7 5800XT is the 100MHz improvement in the boost clock, going from 4.7 GHz to 4.8 GHz.The Ryzen 9 5900XT, on the other hand, should provide a significant upgrade over the current Ryzen 9 5900X. Weirdly, AMD chose that model name since the Ryzen 9 5900XT is closer to the Ryzen 9 5950X than the Ryzen 9 5900X. The Ryzen 9 5900XT wields the same 16 Zen 3 cores as the former in addition to the 64MB L3 cache and 105W TDP. The Ryzen 9 5900XT has a 100 MHz lower base and boost clock than the Ryzen 9 5950X.Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.AMD has kept the pricing under wraps for the Ryzen 9 5900XT and the Ryzen 7 5800XT. However, we should know tomorrow how much the new refreshed chips cost. Don't forget to double back for our review of the two processors and two new 5000XT SKUs.

# Intel Core Ultra "Lunar Lake" Launching 3 September

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Lunar-Lake-3-September)

With the AMD Ryzen AI 300 "Strix Point" laptops now shipping this week, Intel has announced that their Intel Core Ultra "Lunar Lake" processors as the successor to Meteor Lake will be formally launching on 3 September.
Intel put out a news alert that they will be launching their next-generation Core Ultra laptop processors on 3 September. This is timed for the IFA 2024 conference. On 3 September at 9am PDT will be a livestreamed event for launching Lunar Lake.
The brief news alert can be found at Intel.com. We've been expecting Lunar Lake to launch in Q3 and they appear on target and eager to talk more about it given the AMD Strix Point competition debuting.
Lunar Lake should be very exciting with its Xe2 integrated graphics, upgraded NPU, and significant CPU core enhancements as we've been talking about in recent months. From my external monitoring of the patch flow, Intel Lunar Lake Linux support should be in good shape for launching in September... The main caveat is the Xe2 graphics still appearing to settle and the Xe2 graphics support not yet enabled by default on current Linux kernels. We'll see if that changes in the next month or if there may be some near-term kinks to still work out in the open-source Intel Linux graphics driver support. Stay tuned for more about Intel Core Ultra Lunar Lake on Linux in September.

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/windows-linux-ryzen-ai)

After seeing how the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 and AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 Zen 5 Strix Point performance is under Linux against a range of other Intel/AMD laptops, the next obvious question is... how does this compare to Windows? In this article is an initial look at the Windows 11 versus Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Linux performance for the same AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 SoC within an ASUS Zenbook S16 and running the same benchmarks in looking at the out-of-the-box performance difference.
Today's AMD Strix Point benchmarking is looking at the launch-day support of Microsoft Windows 11 versus Ubuntu Linux on the ASUS Zenbook S16 equipped with the AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 SoC with 24GB of RAM. The pre-loaded Windows 11 with all available system and firmware updates as of launch day were used for testing. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS was then tested while upgrading to the Linux 6.10 stable kernel, Mesa Git via the Oibaf PPA, and linux-firmware.git AMDGPU firmware files.
The same laptop hardware was used for testing both operating system at their respective default settings, including the "balanced" platform profile. AC power was used throughout all testing. A variety of workloads with both native Linux and Windows support was used for testing in this initial look at the Windows vs. Linux performance for the new AMD Zen 5 Strix Point SoCs. Unfortunately no power monitoring results for this article due to not having the infrastructure setup for the Windows power monitoring abilities.

# NVIDIA Begins Sampling Its Next-Gen AI Powerhouse, Blackwell, All Over The World, Mass Production On-Tra…

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/nvidia-begins-sampling-next-gen-ai-powerhouse-blackwell-all-over-the-world/)

NVIDIA will begin sampling the first Blackwell AI accelerators across the globe this week as the firm demonstrates unparalleled performance with its next-gen architecture.
NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang Provides Update On Blackwell At The SIGGRAPH, Sampling Starts This Week, Also Reveals Several New "AI Bits"
It was a delight to see NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang on the stage during the SIGGRAPH 2024, where Team Green showed how the AI hype will lead to the transformation of the business industry.
Since SIGGRAPH is more focused on the "software side of things," NVIDIA didn't go much into the progress of its AI products; however, it did give us a glimpse of what's happening with the Blackwell architecture, stating that the firm expects engineering samples to be sent to customers all over the world by this week, showing that the debut of the products is closer than ever.
"This week, we are sending out engineering samples of Blackwell all over the world"
- Jensen Huang (Siggraph 2024)
— Hassan Mujtaba (@hms1193) July 29, 2024
NVIDIA's Blackwell AI products are set to be the most "successful" ones in the firm's history since the firm has already bagged massive demand in the pre-release period, with the likes of Meta, Microsoft, and Google rushing towards the AI giant in order to reserve their slots.
The supply chain is already gearing up for yet again another "gold rush", with partners such as TSMC and SK hynix upscaling their production facilities massively. So, it's safe to say that NVIDIA & Blackwell will yet again replicate the same financial results as brought in by Hopper products, but probably two to five times, maybe even greater.
Apart from Blackwell, NVIDIA also announced progress in its "AI factory" ecosystem, with the addition of features expected to increase generative AI capabilities in NVIDIA's NIM inference microservices. Through this, the firm expects the adoption of AI into industrial workloads, ultimately expanding the influence of the technology to new domains, further fueling the progress.
Last but not least, we saw NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang and Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the stage together. Both personalities discussed the ongoing endeavors in the AI industry, especially the integration of AI into every form of business. Apart from that, Meta's CEO revealed that they have managed to add 600,000 of NVIDIA's H100s for their AI computing power, which showed how deep of a collaboration both firms are currently involved in.

# AMD Ryzen AI software heralds the arrival of five new CPUs &mdash; support for Strix Halo and Kraken Point chips added

[Tomshardware US](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-ai-software-heralds-the-arrival-of-five-new-cpus)

As Hoang Anh Phu on X spotted, AMD's latest iteration of its Ryzen AI Software (version 1.2) adds support for new AMD silicon: Strix Halo and Kraken Point processors, which will compete against the best CPUs.Patch notes reveal that AMD's latest version of its Ryzen AI software features support for five new AMD chips. One is a new chip based on AMD's older Phoenix silicon, while the latter four are all-new Zen 5 offerings. Two are Strix Point offerings featuring A0 and B0 steppings, while the last two chips are codenamed Strix Halo and "Krackan" (i.e., Kraken).Strix Halo is the codename for an upcoming Zen 5 APU design from AMD that aims to compete squarely against Apple's latest iterations of its M-series silicon. Leaks have revealed that the chip is monstrously powerful for an AMD APU, boasting up to 16 Zen 5 cores (on two CCDs) and an iGPU that will seemingly rival the PlayStation 5, boasting 40 RDNA 3.5 compute units (which is more than the PS5 and the RX 7600 XT).Originally, Strix Halo was believed to pack anywhere from 45 to 50 TOPS of NPU performance, but a newer leak from a highly reputable source claimed that Strix Halo will come with at least 70 TOPS of performance, which is 20 more TOPS than AMD's outgoing Ryzen AI 300 mobile CPUs.Strix Halo could arrive with either LPDDR5X or LPDDR5 memory operating on a large 256-bit wide interface. So far, we've seen Strix Halo configurations boasting 128GB of memory, suggesting we could see Strix Halo-powered systems with up to 128GB of memory."Krackan" refers to AMD's leaked Kraken Point mobile APUs, which are rumored to arrive in 2025. This new Zen 5-powered design will reportedly be the successor to Hawk Point—the Ryzen 8040 series—and a like-for-like competitor to Intel's upcoming Lunar Lake architecture. Kraken Point will allegedly prioritize power efficiency, boasting four Zen 5 cores and four Zen 5c cores, 16MB of L3 cache, and an RDNA 3.5 iGPU packing up to 8 compute units. These chips will be significantly weaker than AMD's existing Ryzen AI 9 300 series processors, which come with up to four Zen 5 cores, eight Zen 5c cores, 24MB of L3 cache, and up to AMD's Radeon 890M with 16 CUs.Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.With the latest update for the Ryzen AI Software, AMD is laying the carpet for the chipmaker's upcoming Strix Halo and Kraken Point processors, which won't arrive until next year.

# Mesa's Freedreno Gallium3D Driver Lands Initial Adreno 700 Series Support

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-24.3-Freedreno-A7xx)

Since last year there's been support available in the MSM DRM kernel driver for Qualcomm's Adreno 700 series graphics processors. There's also been some Adreno 700 series support in TURNIP as the Mesa Vulkan driver for these newer Adreno GPUs. Now finally the Freedreno Gallium3D driver has merged initial Adreno 700 series support for the Mesa 24.3 release.
Freedreno lead developer Rob Clark has landed initial A7xx support into this Gallium3D/OpenGL driver. It's reworking around 700 lines of code and adding in another 700 lines of code on top of that existing Adreno 600 series and prior code paths.
The Adreno 700 series support for Freedreno landed via this merge.
The Adreno 700 series graphics are found in the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, 7 Gen 3, 8/8+ Gen 1, 8c Gen 3, 8 Gen 3, and various other SOCs.  Adreno 700 series hardware is capable of OpenGL ES 3.2, Vulkan 1.1, Direct3D 12.1, and OpenCL 2.0. The Adreno 740 series was their first GPU to add ray-tracing capabilities. The Adreno 700 series though is still a step behind the Adreno X series introduced with the Snapdragon X Elite notebook SoCs.

# TSMC To Initiate Construction of First European Fab In Germany Next Month, Production Expected By 2027

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/tsmc-initiate-construction-first-european-fab-germany-next-month/)

TSMC is all set to start constructing its first European fab in Germany by next month as the Taiwan giant moves towards becoming a "global" semiconductor leader.
TSMC Enters The European Markets With Full Force, Plans To Develop Its First EU Fab In Germany, Right Next To IFS
The semiconductor giant is on the way toward becoming a dominant force in the market since TSMC has expanded its region of influence, coming more towards the West. The Arizona facility in the United States is indeed a restatement that TSMC doesn't want to be "region-bounded," and now, with the disclosure of the fab in Europe, the firm may very well be set for catering to global markets, hence downplaying the influence of competitors such as Intel Foundry.
The news comes from Nikkei Asia, which discloses that TSMC plans to initiate the construction of its fab in Dresden, Germany, by August, being right on time to start production by late 2027. It is said that the firm has partnered up with regional firms such as Bosch, Infineon, and NXP, providing them each with a stake of 10%, respectively, while TSMC themselves will hold a 70% share. The German government has partnered up with the Taiwan giant as well, allocating them a subsidy of  3.5 billion euros, which is said to cover half of the costs of the foundry itself.
In terms of the processes, TSMC's Germany fab is said to initially focus on 28/22nm planar CMOS and 16/12nm FinFET process technologies, with room for expansion based on the anticipated demand. The fab will also create 2,000 high-tech professional jobs and will prove to be a breakthrough for the European Union, which has shifted its focus towards expanding regional semiconductor capabilities through incentives such as the EU Chips Act, a 43 billion euro subsidy plan.
Meanwhile, things are looking tight for competitors such as Intel in the region, given that Intel's fab in Germany will be responsible for building cutting-edge processes such as the 18A. Given the high costs associated with such production lines, the local government has denied additional subsidies for Team Blue, further creating an economic imbalance. With TSMC potentially entering the region, we might see heightened competition from the IFS, but that remains uncertain for now.

Dasung has made the Paperlike Color portable E Ink monitor available via its official U.S. web store. This 12-inch device with 2,560 x 1,600 pixels supplements the eye-friendly color e-ink screen appeal with a front light, touch screen functionality, and simple USB-C connectivity. However, $849 (including shipping) may be prohibitive for many interested.The Dasung Paperlike Color portable first became available in China in March of this year. However, now that it is available in the U.S., this 12-incher is worth a closer look at. The main appeal is, of course, the E Ink display. This technology has several advantages: power efficiency, wide viewing angles, and easy-on-the-eye paperlike readability. Dasung has built upon this solid foundation with advancements like the richer color reproduction of this display and an integrated E Ink ComfortGaze front light with color temperature adjustments.E Ink Kaleido 3 technology is behind the enhanced visuals. This new generation panel means E Ink devices can boast 16 grayscale levels and up to 4,096 colors. Kaleido 3 is claimed to boost color saturation by 30% compared to the previous generation. Moreover, E Ink says this third-gen color display has increased responsiveness and is more usable for the playback of animations and videos.Swipe to scroll horizontally Dasung Paperlike Color portable monitor

# Google's AutoFDO & Propeller For The Linux Kernel Helps With Up To 5~10% Faster Performance

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/AutoFDO-Propeller-Kernel)

Google engineer Rong Xu has proposed adding AutoFDO and Propeller support to the mainline Linux kernel for its Clang-based build as it can help the system performance improve in the up to 5~10% range.
AutoFDO is a Google project for Automatic Feedback-Directed Optimization with LLVM/Clang. Google's Propeller is of a similar focus as a profile-guided relinking optimizer for application software... or with these patches, the Linux kernel. These are compiler-based optimization techniques for generating faster binaries and Google has found combining AutoFDO and Propeller to be worthwhile for Linux kernel images.
Rong Xu explains in the patch series sent out this week:
"This patch series is to integrate AutoFDO and Propeller support into the Linux kernel. AutoFDO is a profile-guided optimization technique that leverages hardware sampling to enhance binary performance. Unlike Instrumentation-based FDO (iFDO), AutoFDO offers a user-friendly and straightforward application process. While iFDO generally yields superior profile quality and performance, our findings reveal that AutoFDO achieves remarkable effectiveness, bringing performance close to iFDO for benchmark applications. Similar to AutoFDO, Propeller too utilizes hardware sampling to collect profiles and apply post-link optimizations to improve the benchmark’s performance over and above AutoFDO.
Our empirical data demonstrates significant performance improvements with AutoFDO and Propeller, up to 10% on microbenchmarks and up to 5% on large warehouse-scale benchmarks. This makes a strong case for their inclusion as supported features in the upstream kernel.
...
Experiments were conducted to compare the performance of AutoFDO-optimized kernel images (version 6.9.x) against default builds.. The evaluation encompassed both open source microbenchmarks and real-world production services from Google and Meta. The selected microbenchmarks included Neper, a network subsystem benchmark, and UnixBench which is a comprehensive suite for assessing various kernel operations.
For Neper, AutoFDO optimization resulted in a 6.1% increase in throughput and a 10.6% reduction in latency. Unixbench saw a 2.2% improvement in its index score under low system load and a 2.6% improvement under high system load."
AutoFDO relies on feedback from the CPU's Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) to collect profiling data. Unlike other FDO techniques, AutoFDO does not rely on instrumented kernels with a single optimized kernel serving for both execution and profile collection.
Given these gains and AutoFDO / Propeller being more straight-forward than some other compiler optimization techniques, hopefully these patches stand chances of being mainlined in the future.
It's great seeing Google's continued efforts for enhancing the performance of the upstream Linux kernel.
The patches and more details on this proposal can be found via this patch series.

# This Raspberry Pi Pico W keeps count of your YouTube subscribers

[Tomshardware US](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/this-raspberry-pi-pico-w-keeps-count-of-your-youtube-subscribers)

There's no platform for the modern creator quite like YouTube—nor is there anything quite like the pressure that comes with monitoring the success of your channel. If you want to make the process of tracking your subscribers a little more fun, you should check out this project created by maker and developer Yakroo108. With our favorite microcontroller, the Raspberry Pi Pico W, as the main driver, Yakroo108 has developed a cool subscriber counter that uses a custom board he designed just for the project.It takes the mundane line of text you'll find on every channel and turns it into a dazzling display thanks to its RGB LED matrix display. The matrix is aided by a small LCD screen that gives additional details and stats. Both the Pico W and LCD panel are held together by the custom PCB which also connects to the matrix panel.The primary and most obvious use case for the project is to keep up with how many YouTube subscribers are following a given channel. However, the LCD screen shows some extra information that took a bit of time and effort on Yakroo108's part to program into place. It also shows the current IP address for the Pico W, how much Wi-Fi RSSI strength is available and it can even show the view count for three separate videos.(Image credit: Yakroo108)The hardware for this project is particular and precise. If you want to recreate it, you'll need an 8 x 32 WS2812 RGB LED matrix panel, the exact PCB created by Yakroo108 (which you can find over at PCBWay), as well as a Raspberry Pi Pico W. The LCD display is also necessary to get a readout of extra information without overcrowding the matrix panel with too much information.Yakroo108 was kind enough to make the project open source so if you don't want to buy one pre-assembled, you can go through the fun of building it from the ground up. The code for the project was written in CircuitPython and uses the YouTube API to get the source data. The full project can be found over at GitHub. To get a closer look at this Raspberry Pi project, you can check it out over at Hackaday and see it in action over at none other than YouTube.Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

# AdaptiveCpp 24.06 Released As "The Fastest Heterogeneous C++ Compiler" - Beats CUDA

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/AdaptiveCpp-24.06-Released)

AdaptiveCpp as the open-source compiler formerly known as hypSYCL and Open SYCL is out with a new feature release for this C++ heterogeneous compiler supporting all major CPUs and GPUs.
AdaptiveCpp's tag line is "the fastest heterogeneous C++ compiler - free from vendor politics" and its documentation for the new release goes on to note:
"This release increases performance even further, while also adding various new features. AdaptiveCpp 24.06 is now without a doubt one of the leading heterogeneous C++ compilers when it comes to performance. In many cases, it is faster than vendor-supported compiler stacks such as CUDA or oneAPI. At the same time, as a purely community-driven project, is is completely free from vendor politics, giving the community back control over their preferred programming models."
AdaptiveCpp 24.06 brings new JIT optimizations, C++ standard parallelism offloading using std::execution::par and experimental std::atomic support, runtime latency optimizations, better SYCL 2020 support, and their OpenCL back-end is also now more complete.
AdaptiveCpp 24.06 also brings support for dynamic functions, handling for the sycl::specialized extension, and other improvements.
Benchmarks coming from the AdaptiveCpp developers of this release show that this compiler can outperform CUDA 12.1 and Intel's oneAPI quite often. Results on AMD Radeon Pro hardware also show it typically competitive with AMD ROCm. Intel integrated graphics performance is also in good shape relative to oneAPI.
For the benchmarks and more details on the AdaptiveCpp 24.06 release along with downloads, visit the project's GitHub.

# Last-Minute Details Reveal The Official Image Of The Nothing (2a) Plus, Showcasing Its Design And 50MP T…

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/last-minute-details-reveal-the-official-image-of-the-nothing-2a-plus-showcasing-its-design-and-50mp-triple-camera-setup/)

Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is set to be unveiled on July 31st, and before its big reveal, the rumor mill seems to be churning in full swing. While we have been getting information about the upcoming phone now and then, the latest official image gives a closer look at the device and reveals many details about its hardware and upcoming upgrades.
Nothing Phone (2a) Plus design revealed through official image, and it is slated to come with some key upgrades
The Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is to launch tomorrow, and before the big reveal, the company decided to keep no surprises and mystery to the phone's design and shared an image on X that showcases the back of the phone. Looking at the image, you will notice the Glyph Interface design at the top of the back panel that was sported by Nothing Phone (2a), as well as the dual rear camera setup. While the picture shows the device with a silver tone, we expect more color shades to be revealed at the launch.
Nothing did not only share the back panel image revealing the design and confirming the ongoing speculations but also confirmed a few days ago the specification about the camera. Nothing Phone (2a) Plus would feature a triple 50MP camera setup, with a 50MP front camera and dual cameras of 50MP+50MP on the back panel. While this is similar to the Phone (2a), the key upgrade would be a selfie camera moving to a 50MP camera setup compared to the 32MP front camera.
The camera upgrade is not the only key feature of the upcoming phone, as it would be the first device to be powered by MediaTek's new Dimensity 7350 Pro chip, which is meant to boost performance by 10 percent and bring better graphics and visuals compared to the Phone (2a)'s Dimensity 7200 Pro chipset.
The Phone (2a) Plus will feature a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display and a 5,000 mAh battery. Its peak brightness of 1300 nits will improve the phone's screen visibility in bright settings or outdoors. The phone will sport a 120Hz refresh rate and have Gorilla Glass 5 protection on top of the screen for added protection and durability against scratches.
The upcoming device will have two variants: 8GB RAM + 256GB storage and 12GB RAM + 256GB storage. The Nothing Phone (2a) Plus rolls out tomorrow, and more specifications will be revealed at the big launch.

# Valve now updating SteamOS to support popular DeckHD screen replacement&mdash; others may follow

[Tomshardware US](https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/valve-now-updating-steamos-to-support-popular-deckhd-screen-replacement-others-may-follow)

In the time since the May 2023 announcement of the DeckHD screen replacement for Steam Deck LCD, Valve introduced a Steam Deck OLED in November 2023 that replaced all mid-range and high-end models of the Deck with a quite significant display improvement— but now, they're also updating SteamOS with a patch to fully support the DeckHD screen. The DeckHD actually offered quite a nice upgrade of its own on the original Steam Deck before the OLED Deck overshadowed it, provided you had the tools or resources needed to get the $99 screen replacement installed.Integrating these patches (originally made by balika011 on GitHub) is good to see from Valve developers and makes us hopeful that future display replacements for Steam Deck LCD, OLED, and the eventual Steam Deck 2 will also see the appropriate patches added to SteamOS for full support and configuration to those screens' needs. The specific changes added were for DeckHD display timings (for smoother V-Sync, etc) and simply recognizing the DeckHD as a "known display" to begin with.In our original coverage of the DeckHD, we noted that it claimed 95% sRGB color gamut coverage over the original Deck LCD screen, which most pegged at under 70%. This was one of the most noted weaknesses of the original model's IPS panel—and why common soft mods included "VibrantDeck" to boost saturation and perceived vividness before a SteamOS update. DeckHD helped alleviate these color reproduction issues with or without the help of soft-modding, though its 1200p target resolution was less ideal for native resolution gaming in 3D titles— though realistically, you should be using resolution scaling on these handhelds in 3D titles, anyway. The higher PPI of these resolutions on handheld screens makes solutions like AMD FSR 3.1 shine and even the basic OS-level FSR 1 at least a little bit more tolerable.These days, DeckHD's estimate has been adjusted to 87% sRGB—which is still pretty good, particularly considering it only just got official support. Now, DeckHD users should be able to enjoy a truly ideal display experience (particularly with configuration to preference) on their Decks once the next batch of major SteamOS updates rolls around.Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

# Canonical Saw $251M In Revenue Last Year, Grew To More Than 1K Employees

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Canonical-2023-Revenue-Numbers)

Ubuntu maker Canonical (Canonical Group Limited) recently filed their financial statements with UK's Companies House that offers a fresh look at their financial performance.
Canonical reported their revenue for 2023 at $251 million USD, which is up nicely from $205 million reported in 2022. Their gross margin is slightly lower though dropping from 82% to 80%. They reported a cash flow of $47 million from $62 million the year prior. Their profit for the financial year was $12.5M that is up nicely from $3.9M the year prior.
In 2023 their average headcount was at 1,034 compared to 858 the year prior. Canonical continues staffing up a lot for their enterprise/professional customer needs. 
These numbers are more than double their headcount and revenue from just a few years ago when they were still operating at a loss. Or see this older article for a look at their revenue and headcount over the course of a number of years. Canonical continues moving in the right direction. It appears much of their recent financial uplift comes from Ubuntu Pro paid customers and subscription and services up-sales in the public cloud channel. Canonical's statements note that "significant product launches" are scheduled for 2024 in these business lines.
Those curious about the financial health and performance of Canonical can find the recently published data on Companies House. Over the years there has been on and off talk of Canonical potentially carrying out an IPO -- most recently of plans for it to happen in "2023", we'll see if/when it finally occurs with their financial performance continuing to improve and the company continuing to explore more into professional offerings especially in the cloud and Ubuntu doing well with all the hype around "AI".

# Elden Ring Patch 1.13 Introduces Summoned Spirits Improvements, Balance Changes

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-patch-1-13/)

A new Elden Ring patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing some welcome improvements to summoned spirits and plenty of other balance changes.
Patch 1.13 focuses on balance changes, introducing some PvP-exclusive changes alongside some general ones which improve the Repeating Crossbow, Spread Crossbow, Rabbath's Cannon, Shield of Night, Golem Fist armaments, among others, the Savage Lion's Claw, Swift Slash, Overhead Stance skills, among others, select spells and incantations. The biggest changes, however, were made to several summoned spirits, which now hit harder and have better damage negation when the Revered Spirit Ash Blessing is at 5 or more and when upgraded to +8 or higher. The Mimic Tear, however, hasn't been changed, which isn't surprising considering how effective it continues to be even after getting nerfed since the game's launch.
Rounding up the Elden Ring 1.13 patch are multiple bug fixes. You can learn everything there is to know about the new update by going here.
Elden Ring and its expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, are now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the expansion by checking out my review.
Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.

# Dell XPS 13 (9345) review: Same great looks, now with Snapdragon X Elite

[Tomshardware US](https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/ultrabooks-ultraportables/dell-xps-13-9345-review)

Tom's Hardware Verdict
Dell’s new XPS 13 not only delivers competitive performance, but its battery life crushes the competition.
Pros
+The Snapdragon X Elite delivers strong performance+Class-leading battery life+Attractive and high-quality chassis design+Wi-Fi 7 support
Cons
-The capacitive function row is still annoying-Only two USB Type-C ports for expansion 
Why you can trust Tom's Hardware 
    
 Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.
The Dell XPS 13 long sat atop the list of the best ultrabooks, until a recent redesign soured us (and many others on it) Dell is mixing things up with this generation, as the new XPS 13 (9345) doesn't just use its newer design — it also uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite Arm processor instead of the latest Core mobile processors from Intel.The newfound Snapdragon X Elite power promises even better performance and battery life in Windows 11. However, some of the limitations we griped about in previous iterations of the XPS 13 family are still here, including just two USB 4Type-C ports for expansion and the somewhat annoying capacitive touch bar that replaces the top row of physical function keys.But with an as-tested price of $1,299, the XPS 13 is a force to be reckoned with.Design of the Dell XPS 13 (9345)Dell’s XPS laptops have always presented an air of attractiveness and premium quality, and the XPS 13 is no exception. The aluminum chassis is impeccably chiseled, the keys on the keyboard have a solid feel, the display hinge is solid without a hint of wobble, and the overall footprint makes transporting the laptop a breeze.Given this robust construction, you won’t have to worry about damaging this laptop, as with other lightweight ultraportables that use plastic in their chassis to meet weight targets. While Dell offers the XPS 13 in platinum, my review unit came in the darker graphite finish, which I vastly prefer despite being a fingerprint magnet.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The new XPS 13 has identical exterior dimensions to the Dell XPS 13 Plus (and the latest Intel Dell XPS 13) at 11.63 x 7.84 x 0.60 inches, but the former weighs slightly less (2.62 pounds versus 2.77 pounds). The MacBook Air (13-inch, M3) measures 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches and weighs 2.7 pounds. Finally, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED weighs 2.82 pounds and measures 12.3 x 8.67 x 0.59 inches.If you’re looking for a plethora of external ports, you won’t find them on the XPS 13. All you get are two USB 4 Type-C ports, one of which is used for recharging the laptop via the 60-watt USB-C power adapter. You don’t even get a microSD slot, which is a bummer. If you want more ports, you’ll need to get an XPS 14 or opt for a cheap USB-C hub to carry around with you. Dell doesn’t even include a 3.5 mm headphone jack, which is a somewhat odd omission. In other words, you’ll need a USB-C to 3.5 mm adapter just to plug in your wired headphones, which is annoying. Yes, Dell includes a USB-C to 3.5 mm jack adapter in the box, but how hard would it have been to include the port on-device?At least when it comes to wireless connectivity, Dell has chosen the latest standards thanks to a Qualcomm FastConnect 7800 Wi-Fi 7 module with Bluetooth 5.4.Dell XPS 13 (9345) SpecificationsSwipe to scroll horizontallyCPUQualcomm Snapdragon X Elite (X1E-80-100)GraphicsQualcomm Adreno GPUMemory16 GB LPDDR5x memoryStorage512 GB SSDDisplay13.4-inch, 1920 x 1200, 120 Hz, IPS, InfinityEdgeNetworkingQualcomm FastConnect 7800 Wi-Fi 7 2x2, Bluetooth 5.4 Wireless CardPorts2x USB 4 Type-C portsCamera1080p webcam + IRBattery55 WHrPower Adapter60 W USB-C power adapterOperating SystemWindows 11 HomeDimensions (WxDxH)11.63 x 7.84 x 0.60 inches (295 x 199 x 15 mm)Weight2.62 pounds (1.19 kg)Price (as configured)$1,299Productivity Performance of the Dell XPS 13 (9345)The XPS 13 is trying something new by employing Qualcomm’s latest Arm processor designed for Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs: the Snapdragon X Elite (X1E-80-100). The X1E-80-100 has 12 total CPU cores with a maximum multi-threaded frequency of 3.4 GHz (4.0 GHz dual-core), 42 MB of total cache, a 3.8 TFLOPS Adreno GPU, and a 45 TOPS Hexagon NPU. Our review unit came configured with 16 GB of LPDDR5x memory and a 512 GB SSD.The XPS 13 came out of the gate swinging in Geekbench 6, delivering a single-core score of 2,797 and a multi-core score of 14,635. The X1E-80-100's single-core performance was just a few hundred points shy of the first-place MacBook Air with its M3 processor (3,082). However, its multi-core performance put it well ahead of all competitors, with the second-best ZenBook 14 OLED with the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H nearly 2,000 points behind (12,908).(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Our Handbrake test, which involves transcoding a 4K video file to 1080p, was also a strong point for the X1E-80-100 in the XPS 13. The XPS 13 completed the task in just four minutes and 47 seconds, which was a minute and a half ahead of the ZenBook 14 OLED (6:17). The MacBook Air took third place (6:32), while the XPS 13 Plus (Intel Core i7-1360P) pulled up the rear with a time of eight minutes and 14 seconds.Our file copy test involves 25GB of files, and the XPS 13 completed the task at 1,342.05 MBps, putting it in third place behind the ZenBook 14 OLED (1,358.5 MBps) and the MacBook Air (1,658.63 MBps).To stress test machines, we use Cinebench 2024. We take scores throughout 10 runs to see how performance changes over time (as heat levels build). The XPS 13's first run was its lowest score, which came in at 917.20. The second run was its highest (969.53), with all subsequent runs stabilizing between 954 and 966.I'll add in the disclaimer that we usually rely on HWInfo to report processor core frequencies and temperatures. However, the utility hasn't yet been updated with support for the new Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processors.Display on the Dell XPS 13 (9345)Our XPS 13 review unit came with the base 1920 x 1200 (FHD+) IPS InfinityEdge display. It features a 30 to 120 Hz variable refresh rate and a matte, anti-glare finish. Upgrading to the 2560 x 1600 (QHD+) IPS touch panel is a $300 option, while the 2880 x 1800 (3K) OLED panel is a $500 option.Among this grouping of laptops, the XPS 13’s display performance was a bit behind the curve in our lab measurements. The laptop covers 66.9 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut, well behind the third-place MacBook Air (77.8 percent). It covered 94 percent of sRGB, which also ranked it last. However, it rebounded with maximum brightness, coming in second place at 456 nits (the MacBook Air took top honors with 476.4 nits).(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)I watched the final trailer for Wolverine and Deadpool, which I am eagerly waiting to see. Let’s just get this out of the way first: the image quality isn’t as good as the XPS laptops we’ve recently reviewed, mainly due to using an IPS panel instead of a more expensive OLED. Colors aren’t as rich, blacks skew more toward a dark gray, and the anti-glare coating blunts the “punchiness” we get with glossy OLEDs. For example, the reddish/maroon in Deadpool’s suit and the yellow in Wolverine’s suit looked a little washed out, but it wasn’t objectionable.Personally, I’d spend the extra $500 and go with the OLED panel because once you go OLED, you can’t go back. But if you’re mainly planning to use the XPS 13 for productivity tasks and occasionally watch movies or TV shows, you’ll be fine with the default FHD+ panel. This lower resolution panel may have also contributed to longer battery life (see below).Keyboard and Touchpad on the Dell XPS 13 (9345)Despite the small stature of the XPS 13, I found the keyboard to be comfortable to use. Even with Dell's "Zero Lattice" design, which allows for hardly any spacing between the keys, I typed at 83.86 words per minute via the keyhero typing test with 98.78 percent accuracy.The keys offer a decent amount of travel and are smooth in operation, emitting very little noise from each key press. My only real problem with the keyboard is with the up and down arrow keys, which are half-height (unlike the full-size right and left arrows). While this allows Dell to condense the physical footprint of the keyboard, it's not as easy to navigate when your fingers are moving quickly.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)My other complaint extends to the capacitive touch panel above the keyboard. While its operation is slick, I prefer physical keys. The top panel displays the Esc, Prt Scr, Home, End, Insert, and Delete keys by default. You'll also find controls for keyboard backlighting, Mute, Volume, display brightness, and an on/off switch for the microphone. Pressing the Fn key reveals F1 through F12. However, pressing the Fn + Esc key combo permanently displays the Function row. The issue is that there is no feedback provided from the capacity row of "keys" and even muscle memory wasn't enough for me to accurately press each required touch point.The keyboard also has a dedicated Copilot button sandwiched between the right Alt key and the left arrow key. However, as we’ve previously reported, the current suite of Copilot+ features isn’t exactly earth-shattering. And the most ballyhooed Copilot feature, Recall, has been indefinitely delayed due to serious privacy concerns that were aired shortly after it was announced.If you look around the palm rest for the touchpad, you won’t find it. It’s hidden from view to give the XPS 13 a more integrated design aesthetic. Instead, its border is defined by an invisible rectangle that starts roughly 0.25 inches below the space bar, extending to the left edge of the left Alt button and to right edge of the right Alt button. The touchpad incorporates haptic feedback and delivers a satisfying “click” upon actuation. I actually like this design touch by Dell, and I never once had an issue with navigating with my thumb.Audio on the Dell XPS 13 (9345)Dell employs a four-speaker (4 x 2W) setup, which sounded good for this class (after a tweak). After all, there’s little space in such a small laptop to cram in a high-powered speaker system. With that said, Röyksopp is one of my favorite musical groups, so I queued up “If You Want Me.” The sound came through crystal clear with no distortion as I stepped up the volume. However, the audio sounded “off,” as if the treble was too high, which skewed Susanne Sundfør’s beautiful vocals.And as is often the case with many ultraportable laptops, bass was practically non-existent. This was evident when playing Kanye West’s bass-heavy and eclectic “Flashing Lights” from his album, Graduation. However, when Kanye’s voice sounded off, I did some digging. The XPS 13 doesn’t have a third-party audio utility, but I found that switching the Audio Enhancements option under Sound Properties in System Settings from Device Default Effects to Off made the vocals sound more normal. However, flipping the switch did nothing to address the lack of bass.Webcam on the Dell XPS 13 (9345)The XPS 13 uses a 1080p webcam mounted dead-center in the tiny bezel above the IPS panel. The webcam does not have a physical shutter, and there is no function key combo to quickly disable it. I would have gladly ditched the screen projection “button” on the capacitive function row to have a shortcut for disabling the webcam.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The image quality is overall pretty good, with good color tones and detail. There’s also very little noise, which is a good thing. This webcam is perfectly suited for videoconferencing and is a notch above the 720p units that we see in more budget-oriented laptops. However, if you want even better image quality, you can always take a look at our list of the best webcams on the market.Upgradeability of the Dell XPS 13 (9345)You can remove the bottom panel from the XPS 13, but you are limited in upgrade options. The memory is soldered; the same goes for the Qualcomm FastConnect 7800 Wi-Fi 7/Bluetooth 5.4 module.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)You can, however, replace the SSD. Dell ships the XPS 13 with a small WD SN750 2230 PCIE 4.0 SSD, but a standard 2280 SSD will also fit. You could potentially replace the battery if you’re feeling lucky, but consider any “real” upgrades for the XPS 13 off limits.Battery Life on the Dell XPS 13 (9345)The XPS 13 fully delivers on Qualcomm’s promise of “all-day battery” life for the first round of Copilot+ PCs. Our battery endurance regimen consists of streaming video, browsing the internet, and light graphics work with the screen set to 150 nits.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Under these conditions, the XPS 13 lasted a staggering 19 hours and 31 minutes, which is impressive given its smallish 55 WHr battery. Apple’s ultraportables have always been endurance champions, but even the 13-inch MacBook Air couldn’t touch the XPS 13, as it only lasted 15 hours and 13 minutes. We’d chalk that up as an epic win for the Snapdragon X Elite.Heat on the Dell XPS 13 (9345)Even though the XPS 13 uses a power-efficient Arm-based processor, it can still pump out considerable heat under load. Unlike Apple’s MacBook Air family of ultraportables, the XPS 13 has two fans to expel any excess heat from the chassis. This was most noticeable during our marathon Cinebench 2024 stress test. The XPS 13’s chassis hit a high of 120 degrees Fahrenheit at its hottest point (bottom of the chassis, near the hinge).(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)However, even with the stress test running and the fans spinning audibly, the laptop was never uncomfortable, and I was fine resting it on my lap (even while wearing shorts).Software and Warranty on the Dell XPS 13 (9345)The XPS 13 comes with surprisingly few superfluous apps installed from the factory. We’re unsure if this is because Dell just decided to take it easy on customers or if there was a dearth of Arm-native apps that it wanted to include with the system. The only two add-ons were Dell Digital Delivery, where you can install software purchased with your system, and MyDell. The latter software package allows you to access Dolby Vision display settings and power profiles. You’ll also find the laptop user guide here and a link to register the system with Dell.Dell sells the XPS 13 with a standard one-year warranty.Dell XPS 13 (9345) ConfigurationsWe received a $1,299 base XPS 13, which comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite (X1E-80-100) 12-core processor, 16GB of LPDDR5x memory, a 512GB SSD, a 13.4-inch Full HD+ IPS display and Windows 11 Home. The only configuration upgrades revolve around the memory (up to 64GB), storage (up to 2TB), and display (up to 3K OLED), which range from $100 to $500 each.A fully maxed-out system with 64GB of LPDDR5x, a 2TB SSD, a 13.4-inch 2880 x 1800 60 Hz OLED touch display, and Windows 11 Pro costs $2,559.99. You can choose the platinum or graphite chassis colors with any configuration at no cost.Bottom LineThe Dell XPS 13 (9345) is a stellar ultraportable that truly stands above the competition. It has good looks, it’s lightweight, and it has a good keyboard (if you can get past the capacitive touch bar). But the Snapdragon X Elite is the real star, as it left its Intel-powered forebears in the dust in the Geekbench and Handbrake tests. The storage performance wasn’t class-leading, but it was still respectable. Likewise, XPS 13’s FHD+ IPS display is also a step or two behind its closest competitors, but there are panel upgrades available for those looking for more punch. The FHD+ IPS screen likely helped contribute to the the XPS's excellent battery life. We suspect it wouldn't have done quite as well with OLED.But for all the performance potential that the Snapdragon X Elite shows, it delivers on Qualcomm’s “all-day” battery life promise with nearly 20 hours of runtime in our endurance test. Eat your heart out, Apple! And when you consider that this well-rounded machine does achieve all of this with a price tag of $1,299, it’s hard not to give the XPS 13 a well-earned Editor’s Choice award.MORE: How to Buy a Gaming LaptopMORE: Best Gaming PCsMORE: Best Ultrabooks and Premium Laptops

What an awful looking keyboard. Looks like a throwback to 2016.
I anticipate that people are going to complain about the Backspace key being split into two. I suppose that to the right is a fingerprint reader.

# DreamWorks' OpenMoonRay 1.6 Open-Source Renderer Released

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/OpenMoonRay-1.6)

Two years ago DreamWorks Animation made the exciting decision that they would open-source their MoonRay renderer that's been used in production for a variety of animated feature films. That initial open-source drop took place last year as OpenMoonRay and since then it has continued to be improved as an open-source project.
OpenMoonRay 1.6 is out today as the newest update to this open-source production MCRT renderer. The OpenMoonRay 1.6 release adds initial support for Apple Silicon processors, including acceleration using Apple's Metal API. The OpenMoonRay tools are all working now on Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3/M4 along with the Hydra render plug-in and other functionality.
Some new features with OpenMoonRay 1.6 include adaptive light sampling, Intel's Open Image Denoise (OIDN) engine is added to the hdMoonray denoiser, multi-threaded GPU access, improved CPU affinity control, and a variety of other rendering enhancements.
OpenMoonRay 1.6 also brings build system improvements, cgroups support is now treated as optional, and there are many bug fixes.

# Creator of Garry’s Mod Receives DMCA on Behalf of Skibidi Toilet Creator

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/creator-of-garrys-mod-receives-dmca-on-behalf-of-skibidi-toilet-creator/)

Garry Newman, the creator of Garry's Mod, has received a DMCA on behalf of the SKibidi Toilet creator. The DMCA is a notice for utilizing Skibidi Toilet assets in Garry's Mod, which he is claiming to be his assets. However, most of the assets from Skibidi Toilet come from Half-Life 2, meaning that the creator of Skibidi Toilet doesn't really have a leg to stand on.
Despite the DMCA being sent on behalf of the creator, they did not approve of the DMCA or ask them to send it in the first place. "Significant revenue is being generated by unauthorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere. There is absolutely no licensed Steam, Valve, Garry's Mod content related to Skibidi Toilet." In addition to this statement, they go on to provide their Copyright Registration Number, which shows everything within the meme content that has a copyright.
This includes characters such as "Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, Titan TV Man, and Skibidi Toilet" who all have their own copyrights, giving them the rights to characters developed with Half-Life 2 assets that are owned by Valve.
It remains to be seen what will happen with this DMCA attempt going forward, as Skibidi Toilet blatantly uses Half-Life 2 assets belonging to Valve. The creator of the meme content released a small statement on their Discord server. They go on to say, "Sup y'all. Is there a way to contact Garry? I did NOT strike Garry's Mod, and I'm trying to understand what else is written in the letter!"
The company Invisible Narratives, owned by Adam Goodman and Michael Bay, created this DMCA on behalf of the creator. In recent news, this company has secured the rights to create a Skibidi Toilet movie. It remains to be seen whether this strike came as a joke or whether they were illogical when writing the letter to be sent to Garry Newman.
Whether or not Valve will get involved in this process or whether Garry Newman will make a statement on the DMCA is unknown for now. Still, it's unlikely that Invisible Narratives will have a leg to stand on, considering that the assets they use for the meme content already belong to Valve, regardless of whether they have copyright over the characters or not.

-Expensive-Non-detachable, conspicuous mic-Some of us did not find it comfortable 
Why you can trust Tom's Hardware 
    
 Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.
The best gaming headsets are designed with audio in mind, but audio usually isn't the only factor — or even the most important one. Gamers aren't just looking for great sound, they're also looking for a great mic, a sturdy, comfortable frame, and built-in conveniences like wireless connectivity, virtual surround sound, or game-specific sound profiles. But when audio companies make gaming headsets, they tend to focus almost entirely on the sound, which usually makes for a great-sounding headset — but is it enough for a gaming headset? Beyerdynamic's MMX 300 Pro is the newest headset in its gaming lineup, replacing the second-generation MMX 300, which was released six years ago. The MMX 300 Pro is the epitome of an audio company's gaming headset: it brings the brand's studio-quality Stellar.45 drivers to its gaming lineup. These are the same drivers you'll find in the company's DT 900 Pro X and DT 700 Pro X studio headphones. With the MMX 300 Pro, Beyerdynamic promises impressive audio that's tuned for gaming and accurate, dimensional sound, as well as hours of unparalleled comfort and easy-to-replace parts. But it doesn't come cheap — the MMX 300 Pro is available  now for $300, which is pretty expensive for what seems like a pretty basic wired gaming headset.Design and Comfort of the MMX 300 ProThe MMX 300 Pro is a wired, closed-back over-ear (circumaural) gaming headset with a flexible spring steel frame. It comes with a long detachable cable with an inline remote that plugs into the left earcup and features a rotating non-detachable boom microphone with a cardioid polar pattern. It's a fairly simple, all-black headset, with a black leatherette-covered padded headband, black velour-covered padded earpads, metal forks, and large, round plastic earcups. Beyerdynamic's logo is printed all over it, from the top of the headband to the plastic hinge covers to the earcups.It has a flexible steel headband and very sturdy metal forks that connect the plastic earcups. The earcups don't really swivel, but there's enough lateral movement to account for different head shapes. The headset feels sturdy and like it can withstand quite a bit of wear and tear without issue, but as it doesn't fold or come with a case (like its predecessor did), it's not a great pick for travel.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The MMX 300 Pro's steel headband is covered in a piece of padded leatherette, which is attached with snaps so it can be easily removed and replaced. The inside of the headband measures approximately 9 inches (228.6mm) long, and each fork extends the earcups an extra 1.25 inches (31.75mm) over a series of eight notches, for a total length of 11.5 inches (292.1mm). The padding is thick enough, and, in a nod to comfort, is recessed in the center to prevent the headband from putting too much pressure on the top of your skull.Or, at least, that's what Beyerdynamic hopes — when I first tried this headset, I started to feel some pain near the top of my skull after I'd been wearing it for about an hour. I initially thought this might be because I'd somehow hit my head earlier and forgotten about it until the headset started putting pressure on the bruise — like any headset would (I don't normally wear headsets at home). However, after a couple of weeks of testing this headset and wearing other headsets alongside it, I've concluded that the pain is happening only with the MMX 300 Pro (and it's pretty consistently popping up around the one-hour mark).(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The MMX 300 Pro weighs 11.08 ounces (314g) without its wire, which is on the lighter side. It's not quite as light as the Logitech G735 (9.6oz / 273g), but it is a little lighter than the HyperX Cloud III (11.29oz / 320g), which is, to date, the most comfortable headset I've ever worn. It's also nowhere near as heavy as the Audeze Maxwell (17.28oz / 490g), which is one of the headsets I wore while testing the MMX 300 Pro; the Maxwell didn't produce any pain after several hours, so it doesn't seem to be a weight issue. For what it's worth, the pain doesn't seem to be directly on the top of my skull (where the recess in padding is), but is instead right next to that (where the padding starts up again). I think it may have something to do with the slightly stronger clamping force of the MMX 300 Pro, which you'll feel more if you have a larger head. Comfort is, obviously, subjective, so you may not have the same experience with the MMX 300 Pro as I did, but it's something to consider while shopping. The headset's large, round earcups have padded, velour-covered earpads, which are also easy to remove and replace (the theme of this headset is repairability). You don't see velour too often on gaming headsets, but it's more comfortable (in my opinion) and more breathable than leatherette or leather, and it does a pretty good job of passively keeping noise out. The earpads' padding is a little stiff and is on the thinner side in general, but I didn't have any issues with my ears pressing against the drivers.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The MMX 300 Pro comes with an 8.2-foot (2.5m) PC cable with two 3.5mm jacks for the audio and the mic, as well as a 3.5mm single plug adapter for consoles. The PC cable features an inline remote, which has a volume wheel, a mic mute switch, and a button for standard controls (play/pause, answer/hang up phone calls).SpecsSwipe to scroll horizontallyDriver TypeStellar.45 dynamic driversImpedance48ΩFrequency Response5 - 40,000 HzDesign StyleOver-ear (circumaural), closed back, wiredMicrophone TypeCondenser - Back Electret, CardioidConnectivityWiredWeight11.08oz / 314gCord Length2.5mBattery LifeN/ALightingNoneSoftwareNoneMSRP / Price at Time of Review$299.99Release DateJuly 2, 2024Audio Performance of the MMX 300 ProThe MMX 300 Pro features Beyerdynamic's studio-quality Stellar.45 drivers, which have a frequency response range of 5 - 40,000 Hz and an impedance of 45 ohms. The frequency response range is much wider than you'll find on most gaming headsets, which normally stick to 20 - 20,000 Hz, but there are a few headsets that come close. Audeze's Maxwell and LCD-GX have a frequency response range of 10 - 50,000 Hz, while the wired version of SteelSeries' Arctis Nova Pro has a frequency response range of 10 - 40,000 Hz. Music on the MMX 300 Pro sounds surprisingly good, considering the drivers are specifically tuned for gaming. The headset has a pretty balanced sound profile, with very flat mids and slightly turned-up lows and highs (I suppose that's the "tuned for gaming" aspect). The bass line in Lorde's “Royals” was just intense enough to be felt, but not so powerful as to overwhelm or lose any detail. The strings in Britney Spears' “Toxic” were very bright but stopped just shy of being painful. Songs with a lot of full-range detail, like Enya's Orinoco Flow, sounded especially good thanks to the headset's precisely layered, accurate sound. According to Beyerdynamic, the MMX 300 Pro's Stellar.45 drivers are tuned for gaming. While the company doesn't elaborate too much on what this means, it says that "atmospheric music is emphasized in the depths" and that "in-game sound localization is accurate down to the smallest detail." The atmospheric music did sound good in Subnautica: Below Zero and God of War: Ragnarok, and the headset also did a good job of keeping the layered sounds of cities in games like The Elder Scrolls Online and Baldur's Gate 3 vibrant and full of detail. The one place where the MMX 300 Pro falls a little short is soundstage, which is on the narrower side — music almost sounds like it's inside your head. This did make certain types of directional sound, like the immersive jump scares of Alien: Isolation, a little less impactful (though also a little more chaotic once you were in the fray). It wasn't too much of an issue with games in which directional sound is critical, however — the directional sound was accurate, just not distant. The headset is entirely analog and doesn't have any built-in virtual surround, nor does it come with software to replicate that.Microphone of the MMX 300 ProThe MMX 300 Pro has a non-detachable boom mic attached to its left earcup via a flexible metal gooseneck arm that measures around 7 inches (190mm) long. The mic has a 13mm condenser capsule with a unidirectional (cardioid) polar pattern and comes with a removable foam pop filter. There's a mic mute switch on the inline remote that displays red when the mic is muted.The mic rotates up and out of the way for when you're not using it, but it's still very conspicuous when it's rotated up. If it were removable, like the mic on the Audeze Maxwell, or hidden in the earcup, like the mic on the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro, the MMX 300 Pro could double as a regular pair of headphones. However, because the mic is both permanently attached and very obvious, I probably wouldn't even recommend it for streamers using dedicated USB mics.But if you're buying the MMX 300 Pro for the mic, performance is pretty good — definitely above average for a gaming headset, though I wouldn't go so far as to call it "broadcast quality." My voice sounded fuller and warmer on the MMX 300 Pro than it did on most mainstream gaming headsets (including the HyperX Cloud III, the Logitech G Pro X 2 Lightspeed, and the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro), but the difference wasn't so big that my friends and colleagues could tell without hearing them side by side.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The mic has a cardioid polar pattern, which means it only picks up sound from one direction. While this is not the same as software-based noise cancellation, it's implemented very well here. The mic didn't totally shut out background noise, but it reduced it enough that people were still able to hear me perfectly clearly, even when I was typing on my loud, clicky keyboard and my dogs were barking in the background.The mic on the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro (2023) remains the best mic I've used on a headset, and also benefits from an EQ in Razer's Synapse app. The MMX 300 Pro doesn't come with any software — and while I'm generally not the biggest fan of peripheral software, an EQ for the headset's audio and mic would be useful.Bottom LineThe Beyerdynamic MMX 300 Pro is a great-sounding headset with an above-average mic, but it's missing a lot of the extras and conveniences you'll find on other gaming headsets. I also didn't find it to be very comfortable, but because comfort is subjective, that doesn't factor quite as much into the overall score — it does feel sturdily built and it's pretty lightweight, though the clamping force is a bit too strong even if you don't have the same top-of-the-head pain as I did.The MMX 300 Pro's audiophile-quality sound definitely makes it worth considering, but for $300 you can also pick up the Audeze Maxwell. The Maxwell has a slightly better listening sound profile, but the MMX 300 Pro sounded better with games. Of course, the Maxwell is also wireless, while the MMX 300 Pro is wired and only comes with one 8.2-foot long cable, which is a little disappointing considering the second-gen MMX 300 also came with a shorter 3.9-foot cable for consoles and/or anything else where you might not want a mile of cable between you and your source. (The MMX 300 also came with a sturdy case and a 6.35mm jack adapter — the MMX 300 Pro comes with neither.)Beyerdynamic's Stellar.45 drivers are in its DT 900 Pro X and DT 700 Pro X studio headphones, both of which are currently selling for $270 (MSRP: $350), so it doesn't really feel like you need to spend $300 on the MMX 300 Pro.MORE: Best Gaming KeyboardsMORE: How to Pick Keycaps for Your Mechanical KeyboardMORE: How to Build a Custom Mechanical Keyboard

# AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 Benchmarks: The Fantastic Power Efficiency Of Zen 5 Review

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen-ai-9-365)

As noted in yesterday's launch-day AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 review with 100+ benchmarks, I've also been testing an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 Zen 5 laptop too. Here are those initial benchmarks of the AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 as the 10-core / 20-thread laptop Zen 5 SoC. Like with the HX 370 testing, the Ryzen AI 9 365 continues to reinforce the great power efficiency uplift of Zen 5 as one of the most exciting advancements. In fact, for many benchmarks the Ryzen AI 9 365 was delivering even greater performance per Watt than the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370.
The AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 is a 10-core / 20-thread laptop SoC made up of four Zen 5 cores and six Zen 5C cores. That's slightly cut-down from the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 having four Zen 5 cores and then eight Zen 5C cores for 12-cores / 24-threads. The Ryzen AI 9 365 also only boosts up to 5.0GHz compared to 5.1GHz with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. The Ryzen AI 9 365 also only has a 10MB L2 cache compared to 12MB with the HX 370 while both SoCs have a 24MB L3 cache.
The Ryzen AI 9 365 has a 28 Watt default TDP like the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 while laptop vendors can customize the TDP in the range of 15 to 54 Watts.
The graphics capabilities of the Ryzen AI 9 365 are slightly cut-down from the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. The flagship has Radeon 890M graphics made up of 16 graphics cores while the Ryzen AI 9 365 has Radeon 880M graphics made up of 12 cores but still clocking to 2.9GHz. The Ryzen AI NPU with the Ryzen AI 9 365 is still rated for up to 50 TOPS like the HX 370.
I pre-ordered the ASUS Zenbook S 16 with Ryzen AI 9 365 for Linux testing. The Zenbook S 16 with Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 kindly arrived from AMD for review, so now it's a nice look at the Ryzen AI 300 series line-up. There is also the Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 but that simply offers additional NPU performance over the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370.
The ASUS Zenbook S 16 with Ryzen AI 9 365 retails for $1399 with 24GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The ASUS Zenbook S 16 with Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 and 32GB of RAM retails for $1699 USD. So a $300 difference for two additional Zen 5C cores, slightly higher boost frequency, and the Radeon 890M graphics plus 8GB more of system memory. Otherwise these ASUS Zenbook S 16 laptops are nearly identical besides the SoC and RAM with both having a 16-inch 3K OLED display, thin lightweight design, and chassis made of Ceraluminum.
See yesterday's AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 review for more details on the Linux support. The Ryzen AI 9 365 is in the same boat. Basically with an up-to-date Linux operating system you can enjoy smooth sailing with the Ryzen AI 300 series -- besides needing the out-of-tree AMD XDNA software stack if caring about the NPU support, that upstreaming effort is ongoing. The main caveat is needing Linux 6.10+ and Mesa 24.1+ if the Ryzen AI 300 series laptop is using the AMD Radeon 800M series integrated graphics.
The ASUS Zenbook S1 6 keyboard, touchpad, WiFi, and other functionality were all working fine otherwise out-of-the-box on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with the Linux 6.8 kernel.

# NVIDIA Could Opt For GDDR6 Memory For Its GeForce RTX 4070 GPUs In Light of GDDR6X Shortages

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/nvidia-gddr6-memory-geforce-rtx-4070-gpus-instead-of-gddr6x-rumor/)

The GDDR6X memory shortage might force Nvidia to adopt GDDR6 memory for the high-end GPUs such as the RTX 4070.
NVIDIA Might Switch Some of Its GPUs Such As The GeForce RTX 4070 To GDDR6 Memory Due To GDDR6X Shortages
One of the reasons why most NVIDIA high-end GPUs perform great at higher resolutions despite boasting a narrower memory bus than AMD GPUs is due to their faster GDDR6X memory (along with increased cache).
However, it is now being reported that NVIDIA might face a shortage of GDDR6X memory modules soon. The original story originates from Board channels(via benchlife), which say that the GDDR6X memory may not be available abundantly, creating a shortage as soon as August.
NVIDIA outsources the GDDR6X memory from Micron but due to the failed quality checks of a GDDRX6 memory modules batch, the memory supply can be disrupted. This may force NVIDIA to produce some of the mid-range RTX 40 series GPUs like GeForce RTX 4070 with the slower GDDR6 memory. However, this requires changes to the GPU die itself along with several hardware and software-level tweaks. If it happens, it can result in a performance throttle at higher resolutions, particularly in the case of RTX 4070, which uses a 192-bit memory bus.
The shortage will not only affect the production of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 but also the higher-end cards that utilize GDDR6X memory modules. There are several SKUs above the 4070, including its SUPER and Ti editions, the RTX 4080/Super, and the RTX 4090, all of which utilize GDDR6X to achieve high memory bandwidth. The GDDR6X is currently the fastest VRAM type available on the RTX 40 GPUs, running at 21Gbps effective memory speed and up to 23 Gbps on the RTX 4080 SUPER. On the other hand, GDDR6 typically maxes out at 18Gbps on modern GPUs, which can reduce the overall memory bandwidth noticeably.
Nonetheless, it's still a rumor and thankfully, the disruption won't last forever. The supply will likely continue as usual after a brief pause and Nvidia may not need to resort to GDDR6 memory after all. NVIDIA is reported to adopt a supply and demand strategy to counter this situation and it's expected that the Chinese market is going to be affected the most by this shortage.
The RTX 40 inventory is still reported to face shortage due to a different cause. It's NVIDIA's focus on the huge AI demand, which can create a shortage of RTX 40 gaming GPUs in the coming months. The company is also limiting RTX 40 inventories as it approaches the next-gen gaming GPU launch cycle which is expected in early 2025.
It's reported that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 and 4060 will be affected the most, and whether the availability of GDDR6X memory creates a shortage problem or not, the shift in Nvidia's focus towards the AI demand definitely will, resulting in a price increase of the current-gen cards.

# SK hynix announces its GDDR7 memory touting 60% faster speeds, 50% improved power efficiency

[Tomshardware US](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/sk-hynix-announces-its-gddr7-memory-touting-60-faster-speeds-50-improved-power-efficiency)

(Image credit: SK hynix)
SK hynix has just announced the introduction of its GDDR7 graphics memory, which it claims is the "industry’s best GDDR7." Offering 32 Gbps operating speeds, it performs 60% faster than current-generation GDDR6 memory which is limited to around 24 Gbps. It also promises a 50% improvement in power efficiency, potentially reducing the power requirements and heat generated by next-generation graphics cards that will use this new memory.The company was able to achieve this jump in power efficiency by using new packaging techniques. For example, it increased heat dissipating substrate layers by 50% (from four layers to six), allowing the chip to release its built-up thermal energy much faster without increasing the PCB area it uses.Even though the SK hynix GDDR7 graphics memory is great news for the next generation of GPUs, Samsung was actually the first chipmaker to complete the development of GDDR7 memory, in July 2023. However, on paper, SK hynix offers advantages in terms of power efficiency, as the latter only claims a 20% power efficiency improvement over GDDR6 (versus SK hynix’s 50% claim). Micron also revealed its GDDR7 chips early in July, which the company says will deliver a 30% improvement in both ray tracing and rasterization performance.(Image credit: SK hynix)SK hynix plans to start mass production of GDDR7 memory in the third quarter of this year, putting it in line with rival memory manufacturers like Micron. The Korean company hasn’t dropped any hints about GDDR7 sampling by its partners, unlike Samsung and Micron, but we can assume that the company has already done that after showcasing its chips in Taiwan at Computex 2024 in June this year. Furthermore, the official launch of GDDR7 by SK hynix, alongside the third quarter commencement of mass production, means that it likely already has or is going through the final steps of testing.  Aside from gaming, SK hynix also expects GDDR7 memory to be adopted in other industries, like 3D graphics, AI acceleration tasks, high-performance computing, autonomous driving, and more. Sangkwon Lee, head of DRAM Product Planning & Enablement at SK hynix says, “We will continue to work towards enhancing our position as the most trusted AI memory solution provider by strengthening the premium lineup further.” And with next-gen GPUs that sport GDDR7 memory slated to arrive in 4Q24, we’re excited to see how much power and performance we can extract from these graphic cards, like Nvidia’s 50-series GPUs.Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

# Another Habana Labs Driver Maintainer Is Leaving Intel

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/HabanaLabs-Maintainer-Leaving-2)

It was just two months ago that Oded Gabbay, the longtime maintainer of the Habana Labs kernel accelerator driver for Linux, announced he was stepping down from his software role and leaving Intel. Oded Gabbay was also a maintainer of the new Intel Xe kernel graphics driver. That was a surprising move with Oded Gabbay having been at Intel / Habana Labs for 7+ years and oversaw the creation of the Linux kernel's "accel" accelerator subsystem and more while prior to that having been at Red Hat and AMD. Ofir Bitton was named the Habana Labs driver maintainer following that but now he announced he too is leaving Intel.
Ofir Bitton who has been the Linux kernel software team leader at Intel Tel Aviv for the past four years -- and before that another four years as an Intel firmware engineer -- is going to be leaving the company. Bitton wrote on the mailing list today his pending departure from Intel and thus no longer serving as the Habana Labs accelerator driver maintainer:
"As I am about to leave Intel during the next weeks, I'm stepping down from the maintainer role of the habanalabs driver.
Yaron Avizrat from Intel will replace me as the new maintainer."
The reason for his departure wasn't shared. Yaron Avizrat is now taking over as the formal maintainer of the Habana Labs accelerator driver within the Linux kernel.
This latest shakeup comes as we are still waiting on seeing Gaudi 3 accelerator support within this open-source driver. With the in-development Linux 6.11 kernel there is a new Gaudi 2D variant with little public information on that but so far I haven't seen any upstream kernel patches for beginning to enable Gaudi 3 hardware.
The long-term future of the Habana Labs driver isn't entirely clear either with Intel focusing on their Falcon Shores chip for late 2025 as their next-gen AI and supercomputer chip coming out after Gaudi 3. Falcon Shores likely won't be leveraging the "habanalabs" accel driver while no other Habana Labs training or inference discrete accelerators have been announced yet. So we'll see how this driver plays out over the coming years with the Habana Labs line.

# Apple skips Nvidia's GPUs for its AI models, uses thousands of Google TPUs instead

[Tomshardware US](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/apple-skips-nvidias-gpus-for-its-ai-models-uses-thousands-of-google-tpus-instead)

Apple has revealed that it didn’t use Nvidia’s hardware accelerators to develop its recently revealed Apple Intelligence features. According to an official Apple research paper (PDF), it instead relied on Google TPUs to crunch the training data behind the Apple Intelligence Foundation Language Models.Systems packing Google TPUv4 and TPUv5 chips were instrumental to the creation of the Apple Foundation Models (AFMs). These models, AFM-server and AFM-on-device models, were designed to power online and offline Apple Intelligence features which were heralded back at WWDC 2024 in June.(Image credit: Apple research paper)AFM-server is Apple’s biggest LLM, and thus it remains online only. According to the recently released research paper, Apple’s AFM-server was trained on 8,192 TPUv4 chips “provisioned as 8 × 1,024 chip slices, where slices are connected together by the data-center network (DCN).” Pre-training was a triple-stage process, starting with 6.3T tokens, continuing with 1T tokens, and then context-lengthening using 100B tokens.Apple said the data used to train its AFMs included info gathered from the Applebot web crawler (heeding robots.txt) plus various licensed “high-quality” datasets. It also leveraged carefully chosen code, math, and public datasets.Of course, the ARM-on-device model is significantly pruned, but Apple reckons its knowledge distillation techniques have optimized this smaller model’s performance and efficiency. The paper reveals that AFM-on-device is a 3B parameter model, distilled from the 6.4B server model, which was trained on the full 6.3T tokens.Unlike AFM-server training, Google TPUv5 clusters were harnessed to prepare the ARM-on-device model. The paper reveals that “AFM-on-device was trained on one slice of 2,048 TPUv5p chips.”It is interesting to see Apple has released such a detailed paper, revealing techniques and technologies behind Apple Intelligence. The company isn’t renowned for its transparency but seems to be trying hard to impress in AI, perhaps as it has been late to the game.Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.(Image credit: Apple research paper)According to Apple’s in-house testing, AFM-server and AFM-on-device excel in benchmarks such as Instruction Following, Tool Use, Writing, and more. We’ve embedded the Writing Benchmark chart, above, for one example.If you are interested in some deeper details regarding the training and optimizations used by Apple, as well as further benchmark comparisons, check out the PDF linked in the intro.

# SysVinit 3.10 Released With Better Interoperability For systemd's "machinectl stop"

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/SysVinit-3.10)

While most Linux distributions are running on systemd as the init/service manager, SysVinit is continuing to be maintained. SysVinit 3.10 was released today with one new feature and some fixes. Coincidentally the new feature of SysVinit 3.10 is improving compatibility with systemd's machinectl command.
The lone new feature of SysVinit 3.10 is respecting systemd's "machinectl stop" command for shutting down the system. The SysVinit 3.10 announcement explains:
When the user executes "machinectl stop", systemd sends SIGRTMIN+4 to PID 1 in the container, and expects that to initiate a graceful shutdown (power-off). SysV init now catches this signal and initiates a shutdown (shutdown -hP now).
In addition to catching the signal from "machinectl stop", SysVinit 3.10 also fixes an issue with bootlogd that could cause the service to enter an endless loop and also fixes the formatting of the "shutdown" man page.
More details on this small SysVinit release via GitHub.

# AMD’s Next-Gen Strix Halo & Krackan Point “Ryzen AI” Zen 5 APUs Confirmed, NPU ID…

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/amd-next-gen-strix-halo-krackan-point-ryzen-ai-zen-5-apus-confirmed/)

AMD has added official support for its next-gen Zen 5-powered Strix Halo & Krackan Point "Ryzen AI" APUs which launch next year.
AMD's Zen 5-Powered Strix Halo & Krackan Point "Ryzen AI" APUs Listed Officially In Ryzen AI Software Along with NPU PCI IDs
AMD recently released its latest Ryzen AI Software 1.2, offering many optimizations for laptops running on AMD Ryzen AI processors such as the recently launched Ryzen AI 300 "Strix" CPUs.
That said, AMD can be seen already preparing for the upcoming enthusiast-grade Strix Halo APUs, which will boast a multi-chiplet design based on the Zen 5 architecture. Furthermore, the support for the Kraken Point APUs can also be seen in the new driver. Following are the listings in the new software update:
Image Source: Ryzen AI Software
The AMD Ryzen AI Software 1.2 update also gives us a sneak peek at the latest added silicon revisions. The 'STXH' or Strix Halo can be seen under the '2nd' gen silicon revisions. Additionally, Kraken Point also appears on the list but apparently, it is being named "Krackan", which suggests the codename change for this series as Kraken Point hasn't been declared as the official name by the company. Additionally, the new software update also exposes the PCI IDs for the NPU as the following:
Image Source: Ryzen AI Software
Both Strix Halo and Krackan will feature the Zen 5 architecture but Strix Halo is prepared for a high-end notebook lineup, bringing as many as 16 cores based on the Zen 5 architecture with the most powerful integrated graphics known to date, offering up to 40 compute units.
AMD Ryzen AI HX Strix Halo Expected Features:
Zen 5 Chiplet Design
Up To 16 Cores
64 MB of Shared L3 cache
40 RDNA 3+ Compute Units
32 MB MALL Cache (for iGPU)
256-bit LPDDR5X-8000 Memory Controller
XDNA 2 Engine Integrated
Up To 60 AI TOPS
16 PCIe Gen4 Lanes
1H 2025 Launch (Expected)
FP11 Platform (55W-130W)
On the other hand, Krackan will be a Monolithic design, featuring a hybrid architecture comprising up to 4x Zen 5 and 4x Zen 5c cores for power-efficient operation. Compared to a max 40CU RDNA 3.5-based graphics on the Strix Halo, the Krackan is reported to max out at 8CU RDNA 3.5 graphics.
According to recent information by Golden Pig Upgrade over at Bilibili, it is revealed that Krackan Point will utilize the same FP8 socket as Strix Point and Phoenix Point APUs. The APU will feature both DDR5 and LPDDR5x configurations on the FP8 platform. The lineup also comes with the new XDNA 2 "Ryzen AI" NPUs, offering 50-55 TOPS.
AMD Ryzen AI HX Krackan Point Expected Features:
Zen 5 Monolithic Design
Up To 8 Cores (4x Zen 5 + 4x Zen 5C)
16 MB of Shared L3 cache
8 RDNA 3.5 Compute Units
LPDDR5X+DDR5 Support
XDNA 2 Engine Integrated
Up To 50 AI TOPS
1H 2025 Launch
FP8 Platform (15W-45W)
AMD's Krackan Point "Zen 5" APUs will replace Hawk Point "Zen 4" APUs and are rumored to work in a 15W-45W TDP range. These APUs make a lot more sense for the handheld gaming segment & we can see those being offered in the first half of 2025 once supply gets better. Given the performance uplift that RDNA 3.5 offers over RDNA 3 iGPUs, these will be a nice upgrade.
Nonetheless, both Strix Halo and Krackan aren't going to appear before 2025, which will also see the launch of the upcoming Fire Range CPU, boasting the same FL1 package as the Dragon Range. It's not the first time we have seen Kraken Point being in the talks as previously the lineup was also seen in an Open-Source Linux Driver in June, suggesting that AMD is probably going to reveal it at CES 2025.

# The Current State Of CXL Support On Linux

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.11-CXL)

Immediately prior to the Linux 6.11-rc1 kernel being released yesterday, a set of Compute Express Link (CXL) patches were merged for the Linux kernel. There is some more CXL feature work this cycle but also notable is a documentation update as it now provides a concise look at the current state of CXL support on Linux.
CXL is the great, open standard for high-speed CPU to device and CPU to memory connections for high performance computing and servers. CXL enablement remains an ongoing affair given the multiple versions and different device types / sub-protocols.
With Linux 6.11 there is now a notifier handler to deal with newly-created CXL memory regions to have their abstract distance metrics calculated, which is needed for proper memory tiering with regards to performance capabilities. The CXL code in Linux 6.11 also has a number of fixes, XOR math is added to address the CXL DPA to SPA translation, and various other updates.
Documentation updates to the Linux kernel aren't usually too notable but this CXL pull request does bring an important one: a concise overview of the current Linux support for different CXL features. The "CXL Maturity Map" provides a look in detail at the current state of CXL enablement within the Linux kernel.
You can find the CXL Maturity Map via the Linux kernel documentation that outlines the different state of various CXL features as well as a number of features that haven't yet been started. Among the features not yet implemented or where there's a "known gap" in functionality include various CXL window enumeration capabilities, Fabrics / G-FAM, Global Access Endpoint, various RAS features, some mailbox commands, various multi-host sharing and multi-host memory abilities, and a number of accelerator features.
The full list of CXL changes merged for Linux 6.11 can be found via this Git commit.

# AMD Updates DMCUB Firmware For RDNA3.5 Graphics With Strix Point

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-DMCUB-Firmware-RDNA3.5)

As I noted in yesterday's AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 review and in particular the new RDNA3.5-based Radeon 890M graphics, I used updated DMCUB firmware with the open-source Linux graphics driver stack to workaround some screen freezes and kernel errors initially experience while using the Linux 6.10 kernel. That updated DMCUB firmware is now public within the upstream linux-firmware.git repository for those that may be picking up a new AMD Ryzen AI laptop with RDNA3.5 graphics in the coming days.
For those picking up an AMD Ryzen AI 300 series laptop soon, you'll want to grab the latest firmware from linux-firmware.git so you will be in good shape for the integrated graphics support. With time the latest binaries in linux-firmware.git will work their way into the various "linux-firmware" packages across different Linux distributions, but it will take some time with that DMCUB firmware update having just landed on Sunday.
Strix Point laptop owners can grab the latest DMCUB firmware here that is for DCN 3.5.0 and DCN 3.5.1. The Git commit notes the DMCUB firmware changes as ABM [Adaptive Backlight Management] improvements, enable/disable FEC [Forward Error Correction] for all PHY, and block c-state while handling p-state. Plus you'll need the other RDNA3.5 / GFX11.5 firmware files too but the firmware drop yesterday is just for updating the existing DMCUB firmware.
See yesterday's Radeon 890M Linux preview for more details on the initial open-source Linux driver support and performance to find with the Radeon AI 9 HX 370 laptops.

# AMD’s Zen 3 “AM4” CPU Refresh Might Be Pushed Back Too: Ryzen 7 5800XT Now Listed For …

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-7-5800xt-8th-august-ryzen-9-5900xt-15th-august-zen-3-am4-cpu-launch/)

AMD might have pushed back the launch of its AM4 "Zen 3" CPU refresh, the Ryzen 9 5900XT & Ryzen 7 5800XT, to August too.
AMD Ryzen 9 5900XT & Ryzen 7 5800XT "Zen 3" AM4 Desktop CPU Refresh Pushed Back To August Too
[Update - 30/7/2024] - AMD has confirmed with us that the retail launch of the Ryzen 5000XT "Zen 3" AM4 CPUs remains the same on-track for July.
AMD's upcoming Ryzen 5000XT "AM4" Desktop CPU refresh based on the Zen 3 core architecture has been pushed back to August and now follows a similar launch timeframe as the new Ryzen 9000 CPUs which will also launch next month.
Previously, we reported that retailers such as B&H (US) listed the AMD Ryzen 9 5900XT & Ryzen 7 5800XT "AM4" Desktop CPUs for retail availability on the 31st of July which was also going to be the same day the Ryzen 9000 "AM5" CPUs were originally meant to launch. Now it looks like the retailer has adjusted the availability dates for both CPUs.
The AMD Ryzen 7 5800XT is now listed by the same retailer (B&H US) for retail availability on the 8th of August which is the same day the company will also launch its Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X while the Ryzen 9 5900XT is now listed for launch on the 15th of August which is the same launch day as the Ryzen 9 9950X and the Ryzen 9 9900X.
Interestingly, AMD had to push back the launch of its AM4 "Zen 4" refresh considering these weren't affected by the same quality and testing issues encountered on the new Zen 5 lineup. Maybe AMD just wants its chip to launch on the same date rather than having three different launches spanning over three weeks.
In terms of specifications, AMD Ryzen 9 5900XT comes packed with 16 cores and 32 threads based on the Zen 3-core architecture. In addition to the cores, you get an increased 72 MB cache and up to 4.8 GHz clock speeds in a TDP design of 105W. Along with that, the Ryzen 7 5800XT features 8 cores, 16 threads, 36 MB of cache, and a nominal clock speed bump of +100 MHz to 4.8 GHz. This chip is also rated at a 105W TDP.
As a bonus, you'll be getting the iconic Wraith Prism coolers with the new SKUs as well. With these variants, AMD certainly desires to stick with the AM4 platform a little longer which is great for PC builders who have an older AM4 motherboard laying around and want to try out something new, and considering the large consumer base on the older socket; it's a decent move by the firm.
Now that we have a launch date, details regarding the pricing of the new models aren't confirmed yet, but PC-Canada has these chips listed at CAD 366.99 ($266.47 US) and CAD 514.99 ($374.92 US), respectively. AMD's AM4 platform has been with us for a good 7 years and the company has already committed to a 2027+ longevity plan for its AM5 platform.

# Mesa 24.3 Lands "The Juiciest Refactor Ever"

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-24.3-Juiciest-Refactor)

Mike Blumenkrantz of Valve landed another interesting patch series in Mesa Git for next quarter's Mesa 24.3... This is what he proclaims to be "THE JUICIEST REFACTOR EVER" for the Mesa GLX code.
Following some code cleaning and modernization last week, Mike Blumekrantz has been working to make more of the Mesa code fit and good shape for the future. In the merge request for "THE JUICIEST REFACTOR EVER", Blumenkrantz wrote:
"now that dri interfaces are fully internal to mesa, I'm gonna go full doomguy across the whole DRI frontend and everything it touches.
this is the preamble to a better tomorrow on the GLX side."
The code merged on Sunday was made up of 17 patches and touched several hundred lines of code. This removes all the driver-specific display handling within GLX and cleaning up a lot of other GLX code.
We'll see what more Mike Blumenkrantz is baking (or rather juicing) for the Mesa 24.3 feature release coming out in Q4.

# SK hynix Commences Next-Gen GDDR7 Memory Mass Production In Q3 2024: 32 Gbps Speeds, 74% Reduction In Th…

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/sk-hynix-next-gen-gddr7-memory-mass-production-q3-2024-32-gbps-speeds-lower-temps/)

SK hynix is the latest memory manufacturer to announce that it is commencing mass production of GDDR7 modules in Q3 2024.
SK Hynix To Offer GDDR7 Memory For Next-Gen GPUs With Up To 32 Gbps Speeds, Lower Temps & Mass Production In Q3 2024
All three major memory manufacturers, SK Hynix, Micron, and Samsung have now unveiled their next-gen GDDR7 memory solutions for next-generation GPUs from NVIDIA and AMD. The latest memory standard offers a big improvement in transfer speeds and bandwidth.
SK Hynix says that its GDDR7 memory solution will offer a 60% improvement in speed, and 50% higher power efficiency and will be mass-produced in Q3 2024 which gives GPU makers ample time to integrate it within their upcoming products for Q4 2024 or Q1 2025.
Image Source: SK hynix
Ever since JEDEC made the GDDR7 memory standard official in March 2024, memory makers have fast-forwarded their roadmaps to meet production deadlines and it looks like everyone is now on track for mass production within 2024. As per SK Hynix, its GDDR7 memory will feature speeds of up to 32 Gbps, a 60% improvement versus GDDR6 (20 Gbps). There are faster GDDR6 solutions available too in the form of GDDR6X which can hit up to 24 Gbps or GDDR6W which offers double the channels and some nice power reductions.
The memory maker also confirms that GDDR7 can grow up to 40 Gbps speeds in the future, offering more than 1.5 TB/s bandwidth on high-end graphics cards. A 1.5 TB/s bandwidth can be achieved using a 384-bit bus interface GPU and we are hearing rumors of up to 512-bit solutions from NVIDIA in the works.
Image Source: SK hynix
Memory speeds aren't the only area where GDDR7 offers improvements over GDDR6, the new standard will also come with 50% higher power efficiency using brand-new packaging technologies that also address some of the heat issues encountered on the last-gen modules. The number of layers of the heat-dissipating substrates has also been increased from 4 to 6 which helps reduce thermal resistance by 74% without changing the dimensions or package size.
This can lead to lower temperatures which can allow for additional overclocking headroom on the next-generation GDDR7-based GPU offerings from NVIDIA and AMD.

# PlayStation 5 Pro Could Definitely Offer up to 4x Ray Tracing Performance of Base Model but Path Tracing…

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-4x-performance-ray-tracing-path-tracing/)

The PlayStation 5 Pro could definitely offer up to four times the ray tracing performance of the base model claimed in leaked documents, as some of the system's new ray tracing features will indeed bring considerable performance improvements.
During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a look at some of the leaked new ray tracing features that will be included in the RDNA 4 architecture and will make their way onto the upcoming console, highlighting how some of them, such as double ray tracing intersect engine and BVH footprint improvement could indeed lead to much better performance. The former, for example, will improve the performance of the intersect engine that is used to repurpose texture units as ray tracing accelerators to do the smaller part of ray tracing, which is also the most expensive. The latter, on the other hand, should improve BHV compaction, which is used to reduce the memory footprint for what a developer needs to trace against. As of now, on PC, NVIDIA benefits more from BHV compaction, but this enhancement should improve things on AMD as well as on the PlayStation 5 Pro.
Unfortunately, this recent leak doesn't go into any detail regarding specific hardware changes and does not make any mention of traversal, which is an important part of ray tracing. NVIDIA and Intel, for example, have hardware that takes over the traversal aspect of shooting a ray through the BVH structure, which is something extremely expensive and that is notoriously bad on a "normal" GPU. A patent from Sony a while back revealed a traversal unit that has yet to surface in any PlayStation 5 Pro leak, so maybe the console will have new hardware that will further improve ray tracing quality.
However, if the system really lacks traversal acceleration, then path tracing may be too ambitious for it. Older games with path tracing, like Quake 2 RTX or even Minecraft, could definitely run on the system, but more modern titles, like games powered by Unreal Engine 5, never could, no matter how simple they are. Since games will still need to run on the base model, the scale of ambition of the PlayStation 5 Pro is certainly limited.
The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially revealed. If the system is indeed releasing before the end of the year, it will undoubtedly be finally announced within the next few weeks.

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/ios-17-6-and-ipados-17-6-released/)

Apple has finally seen fit to bring iOS 17.6 out of the beta cycle as the platform has been officially released to the general public for all iPhones. This means that you do not have to be a developer to download the latest build, and all you have to do is head over to the Settings app on your iPhone and download iOS 17.6. The company has also released iPadOS 17.6 for all compatible iPads, and the download process is the same, which we will talk about later on.
Apple releases iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 with bug fixes and security updates for iPhone and iPad
Alongside iOS 17.6, Apple also released iOS 18.1 beta 1 to developers, which comes with Apple Intelligence features onboard, staying true to its word that the AI features will be available in the Summer. However, the build arrived earlier than we anticipated, which is a plus for the feature as it will give developers more time to test it. If you want to install iOS 17.6 on your iPhone, simply follow the instructions below.
iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 can be installed on all compatible iPhone and iPad models through the Settings app. All you have to do is head over to Settings > General > Software Update > Download and Install the latest build. The process is fairly simple and does not require you to link your developer account with your Apple ID.
As for what is new, there are no front-facing additions in the latest iOS 17.6 release, and the build focuses on under-the-hood bug fixes and performance enhancements. Apple's changelog suggests, "This update provides important bug fixes and security updates and is recommended for all users." You have to note that iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 will potentially be one of the last updates for iOS 17 before the company officially announces iOS 18 to the public, We will be keeping a close eye on the latest additions, so do stick around. How has your iOS 17 experience been so far?

# Linux 6.11-rc1 Released With Initial Intel Battlemage Support, AMD RDNA4 Primed

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.11-rc1-Released)

The Linux 6.11 merge window is over with the Linux 6.11-rc1 release now out the door.
Linux 6.11 is bringing many new features across the board. There is initial support for some Qualcomm Snapdragon X1 laptops, a lot of CPU and GPU additions, other hardware support work, and a fair amount of kernel features added.
On the CPU side there is RISC-V NUMA support for ACPI-based systems, some small performance gains at least for Threadripper Zen 4, performance event improvements for more Intel CPUs, AES-GCM optimized versions for AVX-512/AVX10 and VAES, AMD Core Performance Boost and Fast CPPC were added to the AMD P-State driver, and AMD SEV-SNP KVM guest support is finally mainlined.
On the graphics side, the initial cut at Intel Xe2 Battlemage discrete graphics cards has landed, including the display functionality and initial device IDs. But more work on Battlemage will continue in the cycles ahead. AMD RDNA4 (GFX12) graphics cards also appear to be in preliminary good shape with Linux 6.11.
Other changes include UBIFS being hardened against power cuts, a minimum Rust toolchain version is now defined, getrandom() in the vDSO, a nice EXT4 performance optimization, the upstream kernel can now easily build a Pacman kernel package for Arch Linux systems, a new power sequencing subsystem, and more. I'll have out my Linux 6.11 kernel feature overview in the coming days.
Stay tuned for my more extensive Linux 6.11 feature overview and the start of more Linux 6.11 kernel performance benchmarking.
As of writing, Linus Torvalds has yet to put out any formal statement of Linux 6.11-rc1 on the mailing list but the first release candidate can be downloaded via Linux Git for those interested in getting to testing right away.Update: Linus Torvalds has now posted his v6.11-rc1 announcement: "The merge window felt pretty normal, and the stats all look pretty normal too. I was expecting things to be quieter because of summer vacations, but that (still) doesn't actually seem to have been the case."

# WhatsApp Reaches 100 Million Monthly Active Users In The U.S., But Could It Replace Apple’s iMessa…

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/whatsapp-reaches-100-million-monthly-active-users-milestone-in-the-u-s-but-could-it-replace-apples-imessage-as-the-primary-mode-of-communication/)

WhatsApp has long replaced text messaging and has taken over as the primary mode of communication across many countries. Its popularity has gained momentum in the U.S., with users now using the platform for most of their conversations. Worldwide, the messaging service has about 2 billion users, and the Meta-owned services have recently revealed its US-based active users. This is the first time the company has given away this information and the huge milestone it achieved.
WhatsApp reaches 100 million monthly active users in the U.S., shaking the position of SMS and iMessage in the country
While WhatsApp has been a globally popular form of messaging, especially in Europe, American users have primarily relied on text messaging and Apple's iMessage for the longest time, highlighting their dominance and monopoly in the U.S. market.
Meta is well aware of American users' messaging patterns and has been investing heavily in country marketing campaigns. It has placed advertisements in popular and most visited places such as Times Square and featured the cast of the TV show Modern Family for one of its promotional campaigns. Recently, the company shared figures for active U.S. users, which seems to signify that the efforts did bear fruit after all. The advertisements mainly revolve around WhatsApp's cross-platform capabilities and its end-to-end encryption.
Recently, the Meta-owned messaging app announced its growth in the U.S. market in an official blog post, sharing its achievement of reaching 100 million monthly active users in the United States as of July 25th. This huge milestone indicates successful promotional campaigns driving the country's communication landscape shift. Since a significant number of iPhone users are in the country, users rely on iMessage due to the effortless integration with Apple's ecosystem.
As per the blog post, WhatsApp has rapidly gained popularity in Los Angeles, Miami, Seattle, and New York and is expanding to the South quite quickly, with over 10 million users in Texas. Users' being more inclined to use the messaging platform can be attributed to the uniformity of messaging experience across various devices.
Apple is actively working on improving the iPhone messaging experience, especially with the introduction of Rich Communication Services in iOS 18, which will roll out later this year. However, with WhatsApp's growing popularity as a messaging platform, the Cupertino tech giant might be in heavy competition to sustain the iMessage service as the primary mode of communication. The RCS feature still lacks end-to-end encryption, one of WhatsApp's main selling points.

# Linus Torvalds Doesn't Merge sched_ext For The Linux 6.11 Merge Window

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.11-No-sched_ext)

While Linus Torvalds stated in mid-June that he intended to merge sched_ext for Linux 6.11 as the exciting extensible scheduler code, it didn't end up happening... The Linux 6.11-rc1 kernel was just released to close the Linux 6.11 merge window and the sched_ext code wasn't pulled.
Many kernel developers have been excited about sched_ext as making it easier and quicker to iterate on kernel scheduler changes, prototype new scheduler behavior, etc. Linus Torvalds expressed last month he didn't want to keep delaying it from merging and his plan was to merge it for Linux 6.11.
So as requested, back on 15 July as soon as the Linux 6.11 merge window opened, Tejun Heo submitted the sched_ext pull request. Sched_ext has evolved into nearly 14k lines of new code, including tests and related infrastructure.
But since then a few code problems were pointed out for improvement. Then a few days ago Qais Yousef raised some concernes:
I just reviewed this and I think you're going in the wrong direction here. I don't think the current level of review was sufficient and we're rushing things to get them into 6.11.
We really shouldn't change how schedutil works. The governor is supposed to behave in a certain way, and we need to ensure consistency. I think you should look on how you make your scheduler compatible with it. Adding hooks to say apply this perf value that I want is a recipe for randomness.
Generally I do have big concerns about sched_ext being loaded causing spurious bug report as it changes the behavior of the scheduler and the kernel is not trusted when sched_ext scheduler is loaded. Like out-of-tree modules, it should cause the kernel to be tainted. Something I asked for few years back when Gushchin sent the first proposal
How can we trust bug and regression report when out-of-tree code was loaded that intrusively changes the way the kernel behaves? This must be marked as a kernel TAINT otherwise we're doomed trying to fix out of tree code.
And there's another general problem of regression reports due to failure to load code due to changes to how the scheduler evolves. We need to continue to be able to change our code freely without worrying about breaking out-of-tree code. What is the regression rule? We don't want to be limited to be able to make in-kernel changes because out-of-tree code will fail now; either to load or to run as intended. How is the current code designed to handle failsafe when the external scheduler is no longer compatible with existing kernel and *they* need to rewrite their code, pretty much the way it goes for out-of-tree modules now?
Now Linux 6.11-rc1 is out and the code wasn't merged. Linus Torvalds didn't comment on that pull request publicly at least not yet. Looks like some sched_ext refinements will ultimately be needed.
We'll see if sched_ext is further baked in time for the Linux 6.12 kernel cycle to end out the year. Linux 6.12 is also likely to be this year's Long Term Support (LTS) kernel version.

# Enshrouded Adds FSR 3 Support, Difficulty Modifiers and More

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-adds-fsr-3-support-difficulty-modifiers-and-more/)

Developer Keen Games announced the release of a new major update for the survival action RPG Enshrouded. 'Back to the Shroud' adds support for AMD FSR 3, upgraded from FSR 2, although it should be clarified there is no frame generation (yet). They just updated FidelityFX Super Resolution to the latest version, thus improving its quality.
From a gameplay standpoint, the update's highlight is the addition of several difficulty modifiers that allow you to customize your Enshrouded experience. The developers have set four standard settings:
Default: this difficulty is still present as the baseline and would be the recommended setting for first-time players.
Relaxed: reduces the amount of enemies and provides you with more resources and loot. A perfect mode if you are most interested in base-building and light-hearted adventuring.
Hard: increases the amount of enemies and makes them more aggressive to give you a tougher combat experience.
Survival: for those who seek some punishment with additional survival mechanics on top of more aggressive enemies.
Furthermore, over thirty individual settings can be tweaked to the player's preferences, from enemy damage to boss health, player skills, and even a starvation mode similar to other survival games, to the duration of buffs, the length of day and night cycles, and the duration of the Shroud. All these tweaks are available both in single player and co-op mode, including when playing on dedicated servers.
Keen Games also introduced new character customization options with this update for skin color, eye color, eyebrow color, and six additional character presets. Moreover, equipment like armor pieces and weapons can now be displayed in your base by attaching them to newly available craftable props; collectible props can also be found throughout the world of Enshrouded and then displayed on decorative shelves. Last but not least, the crafting menu was improved, the block and parry system was refined, and several points of interest have been expanded.
Enshrouded has sold nearly three million units to date. The full version is still planned to launch at some point next year on PC and consoles.

# AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370: 100+ Benchmarks Validate Zen 5's Captivating Power Efficiency & Performance Review

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-370)

With the AMD Zen 5 generation, the timing is interesting where it's not the desktop processors launching first but happens to be in the form of AMD Ryzen AI 300 series laptops. With the last minute delay of the Ryzen 900 series by 1~2 weeks, the embargo lift for the Ryzen AI 300 series is timed for this Sunday morning where I can now present the first AMD Zen 5 Linux benchmark results. And with being the first Zen 5 chip in my lab, I have been pushing it hard... Here is an extensive look at the ASUS Zenbook S 16 I received with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 current flagship SoC compared to a variety of other AMD and Intel laptop models. The focus was on both the raw performance and the package performance-per-Watt for the overall power efficiency of this Zen 5 SoC. And with it being the first Zen 5 hardware in the lab, I didn't limit the selection to just conventional laptop workloads but also explored the performance characteristics for various other workloads of interest to diverse Linux users and for an idea of the HX 370 potential or similar Zen 5 chips appearing in thin client / edge / IoT type devices. This initial taste of AMD Zen 5 has me extremely excited about the performance potential of the upcoming Ryzen 9000 series and EPYC Turin processors.
AMD kindly supplied an ASUS Zenbook S 16 with Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 SoC review sample to provide for launch-day Linux testing at Phoronix. As back during the Computex announcement I pre-ordered an ASUS Zenbook S 16 with Ryzen AI 9 365, the review and comparison with that nearly identical laptop but slightly different SoC will be coming up in the days ahead on Phoronix. In fact, that AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 laptop already arrived early at Phoronix yesterday (the other ASUS Zenbook in these pictures) and is undergoing Windows vs. Linux benchmarks and plenty of other complementary tests between the Ryzen AI 9 365 and Ryzen AI 9 HX 370.
The ASUS Zenbook supplied by AMD only arrived last Tuesday and thus with less than one week of testing this article is my very early look at its performance and support. So expect more follow-ups in the coming days and weeks. For the most part my Linux expectations for the AMD Ryzen AI 300 series were in order. The AMD Zen 5 CPU support appears in good standing: a relatively recent kernel, GCC 14.1+ if caring about Znver5 targeting, etc. The main caveats are around the GPU and Ryzen AI NPU.
For the GPU you will need Linux 6.10+ and Mesa 24.2+ for the best support of the RDNA3.5 integrated graphics. So if installing Ubuntu 24.04 LTS out-of-the-box, you will be running LLVMpipe and without any accelerated graphics. But the kernel and Mesa upgrade are straight-forward. There is the necessary firmware as well within linux-firmware.git already. But in my testing on the ASUS Zenbook S 16 I began encountering kernel errors and ultimately a system hang around 20 minutes into the boot process. AMD Linux engineers ended up providing me with newer PSP and DMCUB firmware that hadn't yet been upstreamed to linux-firmware.git. With those updated firmware files, the ASUS Zenbook laptop with Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 has been running stable and not experiencing the hangs atop Linux 6.10 + Mesa Git. Those updated firmware files will be presumably made public in linux-firmware.git soon -- stay tuned to Phoronix news to hear when that occurs. For more on the RDNA3.5 GPU performance, see today's AMD Radeon 890M "RDNA3.5" Graphics Run Well With Latest Open-Source Linux Driver article.
On the NPU side, the XDNA Linux driver is finally going through its upstreaming process for getting into the mainline Linux kernel. Given the release cycle timing and distribution timings as well as waiting to see more user-space software make use of the Ryzen AI NPU stack, that's now more something to look forward to in the very late 2024 or spring 2025 timeline for those running out-of-the-box on the likes of Ubuntu. The benchmarks in this article are all focused on the CPU side.
One other issue I encountered in my initial testing was the RAPL/PowerCap CPU package power information not being reported under Linux 6.10... Unfortunately, the Family 1Ah check wasn't added to the RAPL driver in time. There is a patch adding that one-liner to allow for CPU power reporting with Zen 5 processors. Hopefully that patch will be upstreamed soon to the kernel and back-ported to stable series. For my ASUS Zenbook testing I used a Linux 6.10 build with in effect the same patch carried.
Another item to be aware of is the heterogeneous core topology handling. AMD engineers have been working on AMD P-State patches for heterogeneous core topology CPUs but as of writing the patches haven't yet been upstreamed into the mainline Linux kernel. These patches should help with better placement of processes onto the Zen 5 cores rather than Zen 5C. But as these patches weren't picked up for the Linux 6.11 merge window, unless they end up being submitted as a "fix" for Linux 6.11, that means they won't be merged until at least the Linux 6.12 kernel cycle. Linux 6.12's merge window will be in September while that stable kernel won't be out until near the end of 2024. So unless patching your own kernel or if these AMD P-State patches get picked up as a "fix" for v6.11, you may be waiting a while for better Zen 5 vs. 5C handling. With the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 there are four Zen 5 cores and eight Zen 5C cores.
In preparing for the AMD Ryzen AI 300 series Linux testing, I spent the past several weeks re-testing various laptops available in my lab. I was carrying out a wide range of benchmarks in being curious about the performance but with even more added value now that the Ryzen 9000 series desktop processors aren't launching until 8~15 July. So in being eager to see how AMD Zen 5 is performing over Zen 4 and competitor Intel cores, there is a lot of workloads that typically aren't run on laptops being shown in this article. It's just a teaser of what to expect with Ryzen 9000 series and EPYC Turin later in the year if all the generational uplift holds true. Servers, HPC, technical computing, and other areas should especially be a real treat with Zen 5 -- keep in mind with the Strix Point laptop tested is still with a 256-bit data path and not even the 512-bit path new to Zen 5 for desktop and server.
Originally before learning of the increased lead time between Ryzen AI 300 and Ryzen 9000 series availability, my other motivation for the diverse loads with this laptop testing was given the number of vendors offering Ryzen SoCs re-targeted for thin clients / embedded / mini computers / IoT type workloads that may run more database and server type workloads, more applicable to Linux software stacks, etc. So while testing in the laptop form factor today, the results excite me for what we may see of the AMD Ryzen AI 300 series possibilities (or under the Ryzen Embedded branding) in other form factors.

# AMD Radeon 890M "RDNA3.5" Graphics Run Well With Latest Open-Source Linux Driver Review

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-radeon-890m-rdna35)

While the upcoming AMD Ryzen 9000 series desktop processors continue to make use of RDNA2 graphics, with the Ryzen AI 300 series shipping today in notebooks there are RDNA3.5 graphics being introduced alongside the Zen 5 CPU cores and upgraded Ryzen AI XDNA2 NPU. While just an evolution of RDNA3, the initial benchmarks of RDNA3.5 graphics with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 are looking rather promising for both the raw graphics performance as well as the power efficiency. The Radeon 890M RDNA3.5 graphics are working on Linux when using a new enough software stack.
After working past a few hiccups in the initial Linux graphics driver support, the RDNA3.5 Radeon 890M graphics on the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 exceeded my expectations. The upgraded graphics have shown measurable improvement to the OpenGL and Vulkan performance as well as the performance-per-Watt. And... all backed by AMD's continued open-source driver stack.
As mentioned in the other Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 article for this Sunday embargo lift date, to enjoy RDNA3.5 graphics on Linux you'll want to be using the latest Linux 6.10+ stable kernel series and Mesa 24.1~24.2+ plus also needing a recent linux-firmware.git snapshot for the necessary graphics firmware binaries. Unfortunately that means no accelerated graphics out-of-the-box on the likes of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS but come Ubuntu 24.10, Fedora 41, and others this autumn there will be the out-of-the-box experience for those that may not be buying an AMD Ryzen AI laptop for a few months. For my testing I was riding Linux 6.10 with Mesa 24.2-devel via the Oibaf PPA atop Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and pulling in the latest linux-firmware.git firmware.
As outlined in the other article, initially even with the up-to-date software stack I was encountering some screen freezes and kernel errors with the RDNA3.5 graphics on the ASUS Zenbook S16 laptop that was provided by AMD. AMD Linux graphics driver engineers hadn't encountered the same behavior, so may be due to laptop / system firmware specific behavior. But given the kernel errors did reference DMCUB, they did send over some newer RDNA3.5 firmware files than what was currently in linux-firmware.git: new PSP and DMCUB firmware files. With those firmware files, those initial issues went away. Hopefully in the coming days those updated AMDGPU firmware files will work their way into linux-firmware.git for other early adopters. (Update: The updated DMCUB firmware files are now in linux-firmware.git.)
When testing out other kernel configurations and continued testing, I did run into some other random stability issues particularly when trying Linux 6.11 Git. For that I was recommended by driver engineers to disable Panel Self Refresh (PSR) as it can be a bit touchy on some laptops. That can be easily done via setting the amdgpu.dcdebugmask=0x600 module parameter at boot time to disable PSR. Since then I haven't had any graphics troubles with the ASUS Zenbook S16 laptop with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370.

# Linux's Landlock Sandboxed Apps Could Remove Restrictions On Itself

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Landlock-Restrictions-Bug-Fixed)

Merged back in 2021 for Linux 5.13 was Landlock as a means of unprivileged application sandboxing. The Landlock Linux security module has continued to be improved since but it turns out there's been a big hole within this security module since its introduction... The possibility for apps to drop restrictions on itself.
For apps that have access to the fork() and keyctl() system calls, it turns out it's been possible to get rid of all Landlock restrictions on the sandboxed application itself. This has existed going back to the code merged in 2021 within the bits for setting up the security framework and credential management for this means of unprivileged access control.
But the good news is Google engineer Jann Horn has now dealt with this issue of locking track of Landlock restrictions within the "cred_transfer" code. The fix was merged this weekend into Linux 6.11 Git and it's marked for back-porting to all the still-maintained kernel series over the past three years.
Jann Horn explains in the patch fixing the security issue:
"When a process' cred struct is replaced, this _almost_ always invokes the cred_prepare LSM hook; but in one special case (when KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT updates the parent's credentials), the cred_transfer LSM hook is used instead.  Landlock only implements the cred_prepare hook, not cred_transfer, so KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT causes all information on Landlock restrictions to be lost.
This basically means that a process with the ability to use the fork() and keyctl() syscalls can get rid of all Landlock restrictions on itself.
Fix it by adding a cred_transfer hook that does the same thing as the existing cred_prepare hook. (Implemented by having hook_cred_prepare() call hook_cred_transfer() so that the two functions are less likely to accidentally diverge in the future.)"
The fix was merged ahead of Linux 6.11-rc1 due out later today. Look for this Landlock fix coming to the stable Linux kernel series over the coming days.

# Thanks Intel: RISC-V Sees NUMA Support For ACPI-Based Systems In Linux 6.11

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.11-RISC-V-ACPI-NUMA)

The mainline RISC-V Linux kernel port continues to become more featureful each kernel cycle... Last week for the start of the Linux 6.11 merge window there were new RISC-V ISA extensions wired up while in ending out the v6.11 merge window this weekend there is yet more enablement activity.
A second round of RISC-V architecture updates were submitted and subsequently merged for the Linux 6.11 cycle. This RISC-V NUMA support depends upon the ACPI SRAT (System/Static Resource Affinity Table) and SLIT (System Locality Information Tables) tables being present for proper mapping of memory nodes to domains while the SLIT table provides distance metrics between proximity nodes. Notably it was Intel engineers adding this RISC-V NUMA ACPI support. Too bad though that proper ACPI support on RISC-V systems as of mid-2024 remains a rarity...
This secondary RISC-V pull also adds SPCR-based console output support, PPTT-based cache information reporting, 128GB mappings with the sv39 linear map, and other changes.
See this pull request, which was already merged to the mainline Linux kernel codebase, for more details on these additional RISC-V updates in Linux 6.11.
The Linux 6.11 merge window is set to end later today with the Linux 6.11-rc1 release.

# Mesa 24.3 Adds "Legacy X11" Build Option To Carve Out DRI2

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-24.3-Legacy-X11-Option)

As part of the early Mesa 24.3 changes for this open-source 3D graphics driver stack coming out in Q4, a new "legacy-x11" build option has been introduced to its Meson build system.
Red Hat's Adam Jackson has added this new "legacy-x11" build option for Mesa to begin punting out older X11 support behind this option. Mesa already allows building without X11 platform support but this new option allows for continuing to build X11 support but beginning to gut out older X11 dependents.
Initially gated behind this new legacy-x11 build option is the DRI2 protocol support with DRI3 for years now taking the driver seat.
Adam Jackson explained in the merge request:
"This is another attempt to excise DRI2 protocol support from the build. A new list option legacy-x11 is introduced, and the dri2 feature for it corresponds to X11 protocol support for the DRI2 extension. We no longer build that support by default, removing it incrementally from GLX, EGL, and the video frontends. The result no longer links against libxcb-dri2 or (for GLX) defines any xlib binding to DRI2."
Red Hat's quest for modernizing the Linux desktop continues.
See this merge if interested in more details on this new "legacy-x11" option now within Mesa 24.3-devel.

# openSUSE's Aeon RC3 Released With Full Disk Encryption By Default

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/openSUSE-Aeon-RC3-FDE-Default)

OpenSUSE's Aeon is up to its third release candidate as what was formerly known as MicroOS Desktop GNOME for a container-based, immutable desktop operating system. With the Aeon RC3 release, full disk encryption is enabled by default as an exciting development.
The openSUSE Aeon project has been aiming for comprehensive full disk encryption support that is also able to take advantage of the Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (TPM2) capabilities of modern systems. With today's RC3 version that milestone has been achieved.
OpenSUSE Aeon RC3 is making use of Full Disk Encryption by default and is automatically setup during installation. The default configuration is using a measured boot process with verification of the bootloader, initrd, and kernel prior to carrying out decryption of data. There is a fallback mode as well for passphrase-based decryption.
More details on this full disk encryption support by default with openSUSE Aeon can be found via the RC3 release notes. Further information on this encryption support in Aeon can be found via the openSUSE Wiki with the encryption guide.
Those learning about Aeon for the first time can learn more about this immutable OS effort in general via the project site.
It's wonderful seeing this materialize and hopefully many other Linux distributions will follow suit. Especially for Linux laptops used in production environments, full disk encryption is highly recommended but even for desktops and workstations can be quite practical too and the performance costs tend to be rather small with modern platforms.

# EEVDF Scheduler On The Verge Of Being "Complete"

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Completing-EEVDF)

Merged one year ago for Linux 6.6 was the EEVDF scheduler as a replacement to the CFS code and designed to provide a better scheduling policy for the kernel and being more robust. With a new set of patches for this "Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline First" scheduling code, it's nearing the point of officially being completed.
While EEVDF has been part of the mainline Linux kernel for a year, there have been patches since then for evolving this scheduler code with its ideas originating from a late 90's research paper.
Peter Zijlstra has been spearheading much of this work and today he dropped a set of 24 patches that he hopes will be the final version of the EEVDF patches. Zijlstra wrote on this Saturday patch series entitled "Complete EEVDF":
"So after much delay this is hopefully the final version of the EEVDF patches. They've been sitting in my git tree for ever it seems, and people have been testing it and sending fixes.
I've spend the last two days testing and fixing cfs-bandwidth, and as far as I know that was the very last issue holding it back.
These patches apply on top of queue.git sched/dl-server, which I plan on merging in tip/sched/core once -rc1 drops.
I'm hoping to then merge all this (+- the DVFS clock patch) right before -rc2."
So if all goes according to plan, EEVDF will be "completed" but that's not to say new optimizations or other features -- and fixes -- may be tacked on still after that point.
These 24 patches have some code cleanups, implementing delayed dequeue and DELAY_ZERO and ENQUEUE_DELAYED features, and other changes. There's also a patch at the end for helping to better measure thread time in a DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) world due to the dynamically changing clock speeds of any modern processors.

# Linux VFS Fix For 5 Year Old Bug That Could Cause Corruption, Security Issues Or Crash

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.11-VFS-Fix-5-Year-Bug)

Ahead of the Linux 6.11 merge window set to close tomorrow, Linux engineer Christian Brauner at Microsoft sent in a set of two VFS fixes. One of the fixes is more noteworthy that is for a five year old bug that could cause on-disk corruption, security issues, or a kernel crash.
After Christian Brauner discovered this VFS bug, Seth Forshee of DigitalOcean took to fixing the situation where it was possible to mount file-systems with a non-initial user name-space. This could cause security issues, bugs, or even on-disk corruption. But the good news is that the mount with a non-initial user-namespace was limited in scope to privileged users.
This is a bug that was introduced by a patch authored in 2018 and found in the mainline Linux kernel since February 2019. Thus this VFS fix is expected to be back-ported to currently supported stable Linux kernel series.
Brauner explained in the VFS fixes pull request of the problem:
"I noticed that it is possible for a privileged user to mount most filesystems with a non-initial user namespace in sb->s_user_ns. When fsopen() is called in a non-init namespace the caller's namespace is recorded in fs_context->user_ns. If the returned file descriptor is then passed to a process privileged in init_user_ns, that process can call fsconfig(fd_fs, FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE*), creating a new superblock with sb->s_user_ns set to the namespace of the process which called fsopen().
  This is problematic as only filesystems that raise FS_USERNS_MOUNT are known to be able to support a non-initial s_user_ns. Others may suffer security issues, on-disk corruption or outright crash the kernel. Prevent that by restricting such delegation to filesystems that allow FS_USERNS_MOUNT.
  Note, that this delegation requires a privileged process to actually create the superblock so either the privileged process is cooperaing or someone must have tricked a privileged process into operating on a fscontext file descriptor whose origin it doesn't know (a stupid idea).
  The bug dates back to about 5 years afaict."
It's just an 11 line patch (well, actually three lines of code, the rest code comments) to fend off this problem. The code is now awaiting pulling to the mainline kernel and then backporting to the stable Linux kernel series.

# UBIFS File-System Being Hardened Against Power Loss Scenarios

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/UBIFS-Power-Cut-Hardening-Linux)

While most Linux file-systems are rather robust in recovering when the system experiences a power loss, the UBIFS file-system is more prone to problems when a power-cut happens. With patches submitted for the Linux 6.11 merge window, UBIFS is seeing some hardening so it can better cope with the loss of power.
The Unsorted Block Image File System (UBIFS) for flash memory devices can run into problems and have an inconsistent file-system state if the power is unexpected lost. Fortunately most UBIFS use on smartphones or other devices are battery-backed and can safely power down in advance of the battery being exhausted, but with Linux 6.11 are some hardening improvements for UBIFS to deal with this situation.
A set of nine patches are part of the UBIFS pull request for Linux 6.11 to tackle some of the inconsistent problems that can happen when there is a powercut. These fixes and hardening make the flash file-system more robust, but does come with some small performance costs. Sequential writes in testing by developer Zhihao Cheng led to a drop from 412MB/s to 409MB/s, the FS-Mark benchmark dropping from 7131 files/s to 7090 files/s, and other small performance drops noted as a result of these patches. But a small performance cost is better than potential data loss in the event of unexpectedly losing power.
This better UBIFS handling of power-cut situations was sent in as part of the UBIFS pull request for the Linux 6.11 merge window set to end this weekend.

# Open-Source Apple GPU Vulkan Driver Merged For Mesa 24.3

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Apple-Vulkan-Driver-Mesa-24.3)

Merged today for Q4's Mesa 24.3 feature release is a brand new open-source Vulkan driver: Honeykrisp, the driver providing Vulkan API support for Apple Silicon GPUs as part of the Asahi Linux effort.
Honeykrisp is the reverse-engineered, Vulkan driver for Apple GPUs that was started by Alyssa Rosenzweig. As written about in early June, Honeykrisp is a new Vulkan driver derived from the NVK sources as what was the NVIDIA open-source Vulkan driver quickly forming in Mesa as a modern driver implementation.
Before getting too excited about this Vulkan API driver for Apple Silicon GPUs being merged, there's a host of caveats at the moment...
First, this Vulkan 1.3 driver only works now on Apple M1 and M2 SoCs. Support for newer (M3 / M4) SoCs will come at a later date.
Besides being limited to the earlier Apple Silicon SoCs, there's another big factor to consider: the performance is subpar for right now and it's not recommended for end-users in current form. Alyssa wrote in the Honeykrisp commit:
"Theoretically, we now support everything DXVK requires for D3D11 with full FL11_1. To quote Rob Herring:
   How's performance? Great, because I haven't tested it.
This driver is NOT ready for end users... YET. Stay tuned, it won't be long now :}
I would like to reiterate: Honeykrisp is not yet ready for end users.
...
Regardless, as the kernel UAPI is not yet stable, this driver will refuse to probe without out-of-tree Mesa patches. This is the same situation as our GL driver.
On the Mesa side, the biggest todo before the release is improving performance. Right now, I expect WineD3D with our GL4.6 driver to give better performance. This isn't fundamental, just needs time ... our GL driver is 3 years old and honeykrisp is 3 months old.
On the non-Mesa side, there's still a lot of movement around krun and FEX packaging before this becomes broadly useful for x86 games.
At any rate, now that I've finished up geometry and tessellation, I'm hopefully done rewriting the whole driver every 2 weeks. So I think this is settled enough that it makes sense to upstream this now instead of building up a gigantic monster commit in a private branch."
So it's exciting this nearly ten thousand lines of new code Vulkan driver has been merged for Mesa 24.3 (not the upcoming Mesa 24.2 release premiering in August), but it's not yet ready for end-users to light up their Apple Silicon GPUs with Vulkan API workloads on Linux.

# Linus Torvalds Addresses His Latest ARM64 Annoyance: Installing Compressed Kernel Images

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Torvalds-ARM64-Compress-Kernel)

Following Linus Torvalds receiving an Ampere Altra Max workstation from Ampere Computing, he's been dabbling more with ARM64 now that it affords him more AArch64 compute power than his Apple Silicon powered MacBook. Torvalds kicked off the Linux 6.11 merge window by landing some of his own code to further enhance the ARM64 kernel and as we approach the end of the v6.11 merge window this weekend, he's merged some more ARM64 code.
Linus Torvalds landed another ARM64 change for Linux 6.11 as a result of his personal dealing with more ARM64 activity on his Ampere Altra Max system. His latest itch to scratch has been over ARM64 Linux kernel builds not installing compressed kernel images on the "make install" command. Other architectures when running "make install" on the Linux kernel will opt for the compressed kernel image if built, but not for ARM64. Due to the mixed state of ARM bootloaders and not having a built-in decompressor otherwise, on ARM64 when installing the Linux kernel you need to specifically run "make zinstall" to install the compressed kernel image.
Due to kernel developers like Torvalds and other dealing routinely with multiple CPU architectures, having to remember that "make zinstall" can be a nuisance. 
ARM64 maintainer Will Deacon doesn't believe it's wise changing the default behavior of "make install" on ARM64, so as an alternative approach Linus Torvalds added a new "COMPRESSED_INSTALL" ARM64 Kconfig option. When this option is enabled, the compressed image will be installed by default with "make install".
So those comfortable and knowing that their system/bootloader can handle compressed ARM64 kernel images can enable the CONFIG_COMPRESSED_INSTALL option so they can go ahead and rely on "make install" without having to remember doing "zinstall".
Torvalds wrote in the patch that he just merged to Linux 6.11 Git:
On arm64 we build compressed images, but "make install" by default will install the old non-compressed one.  To actually get the compressed image install, you need to use "make zinstall", which is not the usual way to install a kernel.
Which may not sound like much of an issue, but when you deal with multiple architectures (and years of your fingers knowing the regular "make install" incantation), this inconsistency is pretty annoying.
But as Will Deacon says:
 "Sadly, bootloaders being as top quality as you might expect, I don't think we're in a position to rely on decompressor support across the board. Our Image.gz is literally just that -- we don't have a built-in decompressor (nor do I think we want to rush into that again after the fun we had on arm32) and the recent EFI zboot support solves that problem for platforms using EFI.
  Changing the default 'install' target terrifies me. There are bound to be folks with embedded boards who've scripted this and we could really ruin their day if we quietly give them a compressed kernel that their bootloader doesn't know how to handle :/"
So make this conditional on a new "COMPRESSED_INSTALL" option.
Linus Torvalds is on a nice spree of some usability improvements for the ARM64 Linux kernel. Look for COMPRESSED_INSTALL in Linux 6.11 ARM64 kernel options.
