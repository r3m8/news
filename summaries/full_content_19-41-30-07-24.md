# Raspberry Pi 5 hits world-record 3.4 GHz with thermoelectric cooling and firmware tweaks

[Tomshardware US](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-5-hits-world-record-34-ghz-with-thermoelectric-cooling-and-firmware-tweaks)

One Raspberry Pi enthusiast has been working to take the world record for Geekbench 6 on a Raspberry Pi 5. The goal was to see how fast he could overclock the Raspberry Pi 5’s CPU and complete Geekbench 6 benchmarking. He succeeded through firmware changes, Peltier cooling methods, and blind luck.Jeff Geerling claims not to be an expert in overclocking, but he may have been the first person ever to push a Raspberry Pi 5 above 3 GHz. On Pi Day in 2024, he took a Raspberry Pi 5 to 3.14 GHz. Getting the tiny CPU to go any faster wasn’t possible at the time because of a voltage limit in the Raspberry Pi firmware.Since then, new firmware and NUMA emulation patches have unlocked higher frequencies, so Geerling gave it another shot. He detailed his efforts on YouTube, along with warnings that his actions voided the Raspberry Pi’s warranty and also involved getting lucky in the silicon lottery.

Geerling describes the silicon lottery as receiving a perfect golden sample from the wafer die. When silicon wafers are produced, they have hundreds of chips on them, and many have tiny imperfections. When these imperfections are detected, we end up with things like down-binned GPUs.Geerling identified a golden sample Raspberry Pi 5 in his collection and used it for his testing. Thanks to that amazing luck in the silicon lottery and using custom code to set voltage higher than recommended on the Raspberry Pi 5, the enthusiast could push his tiny little computer to clock speeds of 3.4 GHz.Through his efforts, Geerling could not only push the Pi’s clock speed higher than ever, but he also achieved decently respectable Geekbench 6 scores. The single-core score in his test reached 1121, while the Raspberry Pi 5 hit a multicore score of 2219. These are not exactly AMD Ryzen 5 7600 scores, but they are still respectable for a computer not much bigger than a deck of playing cards.Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

# Intel Core Ultra "Lunar Lake" Launching 3 September

[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Lunar-Lake-3-September)

With the AMD Ryzen AI 300 "Strix Point" laptops now shipping this week, Intel has announced that their Intel Core Ultra "Lunar Lake" processors as the successor to Meteor Lake will be formally launching on 3 September.
Intel put out a news alert that they will be launching their next-generation Core Ultra laptop processors on 3 September. This is timed for the IFA 2024 conference. On 3 September at 9am PDT will be a livestreamed event for launching Lunar Lake.
The brief news alert can be found at Intel.com. We've been expecting Lunar Lake to launch in Q3 and they appear on target and eager to talk more about it given the AMD Strix Point competition debuting.
Lunar Lake should be very exciting with its Xe2 integrated graphics, upgraded NPU, and significant CPU core enhancements as we've been talking about in recent months. From my external monitoring of the patch flow, Intel Lunar Lake Linux support should be in good shape for launching in September... The main caveat is the Xe2 graphics still appearing to settle and the Xe2 graphics support not yet enabled by default on current Linux kernels. We'll see if that changes in the next month or if there may be some near-term kinks to still work out in the open-source Intel Linux graphics driver support. Stay tuned for more about Intel Core Ultra Lunar Lake on Linux in September.

# iPhone 16 Pro ‘Widely Expected’ To Launch With Wi-Fi 7 Connectivity Standard For Faster Down…

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-wi-fi-7-chip-for-faster-speeds/)

The iPhone 16 Pro models are shaping to be quite an upgrade over the current lineup, as the devices will not only come with dedicated Apple Intelligence features but also pack top-of-the-line internals. It has now been reported that Apple will launch the iPhone 16 Pro models in September with support for Wi-Fi 7, allowing users to enjoy faster upload and download speeds. However, the standard models were not included in the latest report, which indicates that the duo will continue to feature the same Wi-Fi chips.
iPhone 16 Pro models "widely expected" to launch with Wi-Fi 7 chip for faster connectivity
As mentioned, Apple will launch this year's 'Pro' models with major upgrades, and connectivity has not been left behind as well. As per DigiTimes, Apple is slated to incorporate a Wi-Fi 7 chip inside the iPhone 16 Pro models, allowing the device to use three bands simultaneously. If you are not familiar with it, Wi-Fi 7 will enable the 'Pro' iPhone 16 models to download and upload data above the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands. This will ultimately boost wireless speeds and promote lower latency.
Overall, the new connectivity upgrade will allow the iPhone 16 Pro to lag less when it comes to wireless data and provide seamless speeds over 40 Gbps. This means that the data transfer speeds will be at least four times higher than the Wi-Fi 6E standard on the iPhone 15 models. Take note that this is not the first time that we have heard details on the subject, as analyst Jeff Pu has also speculated the same integration for the iPhone 16 Pro models.
To take advantage of the higher bands and Wi-Fi 7 as a whole. Users should own a dedicated router that supports the technology. If you do not have one, the iPhone 16 Pro will stick to the conventional speeds. The iPhone 16 Pro will be a solid upgrade over the iPhone 16 Pro models, and while the design will be mostly the same, it will be a little bigger than the current models. However, we are most excited about the new Capture Button and how it would respond to the camera features.
Other than the physical attributes of the devices, Apple Intelligence will play a major role in gathering demand for the handset as well. However, it appears that Apple has delayed the release of Apple Intelligence for the iPhone, as it recently released iOS 18.1 beta to developers. It is yet to be seen if the delay of AI features will have an impact on the demand for the iPhone 16 models.

# AMD denies reports of Ryzen 5000XT launch delay &mdash; chips on schedule for release this month

[Tomshardware US](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-denies-reports-of-ryzen-5000xt-launch-delay-chipmaker-says-chips-on-schedule-for-release-tomorrow)

Despite media reports that AMD has delayed its Ryzen 5000XT processors, AMD told Tom's Hardware that the Ryzen 9 5900XT and the Ryzen 7 5800XT will launch as scheduled. The chipmaker had previously slated the 5000XT launch for July, meaning the chips should be available at retail tomorrow."There has been no change to the sales embargo of the 5000XT," an AMD representative confirmed to Tom's Hardware.Fueled by an updated product listing at B&H Photo Video, several media outlets reported today that AMD's Ryzen 5000XT had been delayed. The retailer moved the pre-order launch dates of the Ryzen 9 5900XT and the Ryzen 7 5800XT to August 15 and August 8, respectively, which is 15 days after AMD's target launch date in July. However, AMD has confirmed that this isn't the case.B&H Photo's delayed pre-order times led to reports that AMD would delay the launch of its Ryzen 5000XT processors, just like what happened to the Ryzen 9000 chips due to quality issues. A branding typo could have contributed to the delay for the Ryzen 9000 chips, but it isn't clear if that is the only underlying issue. In either case, AMD is pulling back the Ryzen 9000 chips in its supply chain to re-screen them for unspecified quality issue(s). AMD will now launch the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X processors on August 8. The higher-end Ryzen 9 9950X and Ryzen 9 9900X will be delayed until August 15.   There are a few possibilities for the sudden change to B&H Photo Video's pre-order listings. For instance, the Ryzen 9 5900XT and the Ryzen 7 5800XT listings could simply be placeholders, which is common with foreign retailers whose pricing and dates don't always match the official information. Or perhaps the person revising the listing mistakenly used the same launch date as the Ryzen 9000 series.As a quick recap, the Ryzen 7 5800XT is an almost identical twin to the Ryzen 7 5800X, featuring eight Zen 3 cores, 32MB of L3 cache, and a 105W TDP. AMD's only change to the Ryzen 7 5800XT is the 100MHz improvement in the boost clock, going from 4.7 GHz to 4.8 GHz.The Ryzen 9 5900XT, on the other hand, should provide a significant upgrade over the current Ryzen 9 5900X. Weirdly, AMD chose that model name since the Ryzen 9 5900XT is closer to the Ryzen 9 5950X than the Ryzen 9 5900X. The Ryzen 9 5900XT wields the same 16 Zen 3 cores as the former in addition to the 64MB L3 cache and 105W TDP. The Ryzen 9 5900XT has a 100 MHz lower base and boost clock than the Ryzen 9 5950X.Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.AMD has kept the pricing under wraps for the Ryzen 9 5900XT and the Ryzen 7 5800XT. However, we should know tomorrow how much the new refreshed chips cost. Don't forget to double back for our review of the two processors and two new 5000XT SKUs.

After seeing how the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 and AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 Zen 5 Strix Point performance is under Linux against a range of other Intel/AMD laptops, the next obvious question is... how does this compare to Windows? In this article is an initial look at the Windows 11 versus Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Linux performance for the same AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 SoC within an ASUS Zenbook S16 and running the same benchmarks in looking at the out-of-the-box performance difference.
Today's AMD Strix Point benchmarking is looking at the launch-day support of Microsoft Windows 11 versus Ubuntu Linux on the ASUS Zenbook S16 equipped with the AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 SoC with 24GB of RAM. The pre-loaded Windows 11 with all available system and firmware updates as of launch day were used for testing. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS was then tested while upgrading to the Linux 6.10 stable kernel, Mesa Git via the Oibaf PPA, and linux-firmware.git AMDGPU firmware files.
The same laptop hardware was used for testing both operating system at their respective default settings, including the "balanced" platform profile. AC power was used throughout all testing. A variety of workloads with both native Linux and Windows support was used for testing in this initial look at the Windows vs. Linux performance for the new AMD Zen 5 Strix Point SoCs. Unfortunately no power monitoring results for this article due to not having the infrastructure setup for the Windows power monitoring abilities.

# AMD Ryzen AI software heralds the arrival of five new CPUs &mdash; support for Strix Halo and Kraken Point chips added

[Tomshardware US](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-ai-software-heralds-the-arrival-of-five-new-cpus)

As Hoang Anh Phu on X spotted, AMD's latest iteration of its Ryzen AI Software (version 1.2) adds support for new AMD silicon: Strix Halo and Kraken Point processors, which will compete against the best CPUs.Patch notes reveal that AMD's latest version of its Ryzen AI software features support for five new AMD chips. One is a new chip based on AMD's older Phoenix silicon, while the latter four are all-new Zen 5 offerings. Two are Strix Point offerings featuring A0 and B0 steppings, while the last two chips are codenamed Strix Halo and "Krackan" (i.e., Kraken).Strix Halo is the codename for an upcoming Zen 5 APU design from AMD that aims to compete squarely against Apple's latest iterations of its M-series silicon. Leaks have revealed that the chip is monstrously powerful for an AMD APU, boasting up to 16 Zen 5 cores (on two CCDs) and an iGPU that will seemingly rival the PlayStation 5, boasting 40 RDNA 3.5 compute units (which is more than the PS5 and the RX 7600 XT).Originally, Strix Halo was believed to pack anywhere from 45 to 50 TOPS of NPU performance, but a newer leak from a highly reputable source claimed that Strix Halo will come with at least 70 TOPS of performance, which is 20 more TOPS than AMD's outgoing Ryzen AI 300 mobile CPUs.Strix Halo could arrive with either LPDDR5X or LPDDR5 memory operating on a large 256-bit wide interface. So far, we've seen Strix Halo configurations boasting 128GB of memory, suggesting we could see Strix Halo-powered systems with up to 128GB of memory."Krackan" refers to AMD's leaked Kraken Point mobile APUs, which are rumored to arrive in 2025. This new Zen 5-powered design will reportedly be the successor to Hawk Point—the Ryzen 8040 series—and a like-for-like competitor to Intel's upcoming Lunar Lake architecture. Kraken Point will allegedly prioritize power efficiency, boasting four Zen 5 cores and four Zen 5c cores, 16MB of L3 cache, and an RDNA 3.5 iGPU packing up to 8 compute units. These chips will be significantly weaker than AMD's existing Ryzen AI 9 300 series processors, which come with up to four Zen 5 cores, eight Zen 5c cores, 24MB of L3 cache, and up to AMD's Radeon 890M with 16 CUs.Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.With the latest update for the Ryzen AI Software, AMD is laying the carpet for the chipmaker's upcoming Strix Halo and Kraken Point processors, which won't arrive until next year.

# NVIDIA Begins Sampling Its Next-Gen AI Powerhouse, Blackwell, All Over The World, Mass Production On-Tra…

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/nvidia-begins-sampling-next-gen-ai-powerhouse-blackwell-all-over-the-world/)

NVIDIA will begin sampling the first Blackwell AI accelerators across the globe this week as the firm demonstrates unparalleled performance with its next-gen architecture.
NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang Provides Update On Blackwell At The SIGGRAPH, Sampling Starts This Week, Also Reveals Several New "AI Bits"
It was a delight to see NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang on the stage during the SIGGRAPH 2024, where Team Green showed how the AI hype will lead to the transformation of the business industry.
Since SIGGRAPH is more focused on the "software side of things," NVIDIA didn't go much into the progress of its AI products; however, it did give us a glimpse of what's happening with the Blackwell architecture, stating that the firm expects engineering samples to be sent to customers all over the world by this week, showing that the debut of the products is closer than ever.
"This week, we are sending out engineering samples of Blackwell all over the world"
- Jensen Huang (Siggraph 2024)
— Hassan Mujtaba (@hms1193) July 29, 2024
NVIDIA's Blackwell AI products are set to be the most "successful" ones in the firm's history since the firm has already bagged massive demand in the pre-release period, with the likes of Meta, Microsoft, and Google rushing towards the AI giant in order to reserve their slots.
The supply chain is already gearing up for yet again another "gold rush", with partners such as TSMC and SK hynix upscaling their production facilities massively. So, it's safe to say that NVIDIA & Blackwell will yet again replicate the same financial results as brought in by Hopper products, but probably two to five times, maybe even greater.
Apart from Blackwell, NVIDIA also announced progress in its "AI factory" ecosystem, with the addition of features expected to increase generative AI capabilities in NVIDIA's NIM inference microservices. Through this, the firm expects the adoption of AI into industrial workloads, ultimately expanding the influence of the technology to new domains, further fueling the progress.
Last but not least, we saw NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang and Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the stage together. Both personalities discussed the ongoing endeavors in the AI industry, especially the integration of AI into every form of business. Apart from that, Meta's CEO revealed that they have managed to add 600,000 of NVIDIA's H100s for their AI computing power, which showed how deep of a collaboration both firms are currently involved in.

Dasung has made the Paperlike Color portable E Ink monitor available via its official U.S. web store. This 12-inch device with 2,560 x 1,600 pixels supplements the eye-friendly color e-ink screen appeal with a front light, touch screen functionality, and simple USB-C connectivity. However, $849 (including shipping) may be prohibitive for many interested.The Dasung Paperlike Color portable first became available in China in March of this year. However, now that it is available in the U.S., this 12-incher is worth a closer look at. The main appeal is, of course, the E Ink display. This technology has several advantages: power efficiency, wide viewing angles, and easy-on-the-eye paperlike readability. Dasung has built upon this solid foundation with advancements like the richer color reproduction of this display and an integrated E Ink ComfortGaze front light with color temperature adjustments.E Ink Kaleido 3 technology is behind the enhanced visuals. This new generation panel means E Ink devices can boast 16 grayscale levels and up to 4,096 colors. Kaleido 3 is claimed to boost color saturation by 30% compared to the previous generation. Moreover, E Ink says this third-gen color display has increased responsiveness and is more usable for the playback of animations and videos.Swipe to scroll horizontally Dasung Paperlike Color portable monitor

This Dasung monitor will surely be on the radar of those who like the fundamental appeal of E Ink technologies and are watching out for a portable monitor. Extra frills like Kaleido 3 color saturation and ComfortGaze lighting help build the case for this device. However, a screen just 12 inches in diagonal but touted as a remedy for eye strain creates some dissonance. Last but not least, the price is very high, as we mentioned in the introduction, but E Ink aficionados should be used to that by now.(Image credit: Dasung)We keep a close eye on portable monitors, as our Best Portable Monitors 2024 feature shows.

# TSMC To Initiate Construction of First European Fab In Germany Next Month, Production Expected By 2027

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/tsmc-initiate-construction-first-european-fab-germany-next-month/)

TSMC is all set to start constructing its first European fab in Germany by next month as the Taiwan giant moves towards becoming a "global" semiconductor leader.
TSMC Enters The European Markets With Full Force, Plans To Develop Its First EU Fab In Germany, Right Next To IFS
The semiconductor giant is on the way toward becoming a dominant force in the market since TSMC has expanded its region of influence, coming more towards the West. The Arizona facility in the United States is indeed a restatement that TSMC doesn't want to be "region-bounded," and now, with the disclosure of the fab in Europe, the firm may very well be set for catering to global markets, hence downplaying the influence of competitors such as Intel Foundry.
The news comes from Nikkei Asia, which discloses that TSMC plans to initiate the construction of its fab in Dresden, Germany, by August, being right on time to start production by late 2027. It is said that the firm has partnered up with regional firms such as Bosch, Infineon, and NXP, providing them each with a stake of 10%, respectively, while TSMC themselves will hold a 70% share. The German government has partnered up with the Taiwan giant as well, allocating them a subsidy of  3.5 billion euros, which is said to cover half of the costs of the foundry itself.
In terms of the processes, TSMC's Germany fab is said to initially focus on 28/22nm planar CMOS and 16/12nm FinFET process technologies, with room for expansion based on the anticipated demand. The fab will also create 2,000 high-tech professional jobs and will prove to be a breakthrough for the European Union, which has shifted its focus towards expanding regional semiconductor capabilities through incentives such as the EU Chips Act, a 43 billion euro subsidy plan.
Meanwhile, things are looking tight for competitors such as Intel in the region, given that Intel's fab in Germany will be responsible for building cutting-edge processes such as the 18A. Given the high costs associated with such production lines, the local government has denied additional subsidies for Team Blue, further creating an economic imbalance. With TSMC potentially entering the region, we might see heightened competition from the IFS, but that remains uncertain for now.

# This Raspberry Pi Pico W keeps count of your YouTube subscribers

[Tomshardware US](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/this-raspberry-pi-pico-w-keeps-count-of-your-youtube-subscribers)

There's no platform for the modern creator quite like YouTube—nor is there anything quite like the pressure that comes with monitoring the success of your channel. If you want to make the process of tracking your subscribers a little more fun, you should check out this project created by maker and developer Yakroo108. With our favorite microcontroller, the Raspberry Pi Pico W, as the main driver, Yakroo108 has developed a cool subscriber counter that uses a custom board he designed just for the project.It takes the mundane line of text you'll find on every channel and turns it into a dazzling display thanks to its RGB LED matrix display. The matrix is aided by a small LCD screen that gives additional details and stats. Both the Pico W and LCD panel are held together by the custom PCB which also connects to the matrix panel.The primary and most obvious use case for the project is to keep up with how many YouTube subscribers are following a given channel. However, the LCD screen shows some extra information that took a bit of time and effort on Yakroo108's part to program into place. It also shows the current IP address for the Pico W, how much Wi-Fi RSSI strength is available and it can even show the view count for three separate videos.(Image credit: Yakroo108)The hardware for this project is particular and precise. If you want to recreate it, you'll need an 8 x 32 WS2812 RGB LED matrix panel, the exact PCB created by Yakroo108 (which you can find over at PCBWay), as well as a Raspberry Pi Pico W. The LCD display is also necessary to get a readout of extra information without overcrowding the matrix panel with too much information.Yakroo108 was kind enough to make the project open source so if you don't want to buy one pre-assembled, you can go through the fun of building it from the ground up. The code for the project was written in CircuitPython and uses the YouTube API to get the source data. The full project can be found over at GitHub. To get a closer look at this Raspberry Pi project, you can check it out over at Hackaday and see it in action over at none other than YouTube.Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

# Last-Minute Details Reveal The Official Image Of The Nothing (2a) Plus, Showcasing Its Design And 50MP T…

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/last-minute-details-reveal-the-official-image-of-the-nothing-2a-plus-showcasing-its-design-and-50mp-triple-camera-setup/)

Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is set to be unveiled on July 31st, and before its big reveal, the rumor mill seems to be churning in full swing. While we have been getting information about the upcoming phone now and then, the latest official image gives a closer look at the device and reveals many details about its hardware and upcoming upgrades.
Nothing Phone (2a) Plus design revealed through official image, and it is slated to come with some key upgrades
The Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is to launch tomorrow, and before the big reveal, the company decided to keep no surprises and mystery to the phone's design and shared an image on X that showcases the back of the phone. Looking at the image, you will notice the Glyph Interface design at the top of the back panel that was sported by Nothing Phone (2a), as well as the dual rear camera setup. While the picture shows the device with a silver tone, we expect more color shades to be revealed at the launch.
Nothing did not only share the back panel image revealing the design and confirming the ongoing speculations but also confirmed a few days ago the specification about the camera. Nothing Phone (2a) Plus would feature a triple 50MP camera setup, with a 50MP front camera and dual cameras of 50MP+50MP on the back panel. While this is similar to the Phone (2a), the key upgrade would be a selfie camera moving to a 50MP camera setup compared to the 32MP front camera.
The camera upgrade is not the only key feature of the upcoming phone, as it would be the first device to be powered by MediaTek's new Dimensity 7350 Pro chip, which is meant to boost performance by 10 percent and bring better graphics and visuals compared to the Phone (2a)'s Dimensity 7200 Pro chipset.
The Phone (2a) Plus will feature a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display and a 5,000 mAh battery. Its peak brightness of 1300 nits will improve the phone's screen visibility in bright settings or outdoors. The phone will sport a 120Hz refresh rate and have Gorilla Glass 5 protection on top of the screen for added protection and durability against scratches.
The upcoming device will have two variants: 8GB RAM + 256GB storage and 12GB RAM + 256GB storage. The Nothing Phone (2a) Plus rolls out tomorrow, and more specifications will be revealed at the big launch.

# Elden Ring Patch 1.13 Introduces Summoned Spirits Improvements, Balance Changes

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-patch-1-13/)

A new Elden Ring patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing some welcome improvements to summoned spirits and plenty of other balance changes.
Patch 1.13 focuses on balance changes, introducing some PvP-exclusive changes alongside some general ones which improve the Repeating Crossbow, Spread Crossbow, Rabbath's Cannon, Shield of Night, Golem Fist armaments, among others, the Savage Lion's Claw, Swift Slash, Overhead Stance skills, among others, select spells and incantations. The biggest changes, however, were made to several summoned spirits, which now hit harder and have better damage negation when the Revered Spirit Ash Blessing is at 5 or more and when upgraded to +8 or higher. The Mimic Tear, however, hasn't been changed, which isn't surprising considering how effective it continues to be even after getting nerfed since the game's launch.
Rounding up the Elden Ring 1.13 patch are multiple bug fixes. You can learn everything there is to know about the new update by going here.
Elden Ring and its expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, are now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the expansion by checking out my review.
Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.

# Creator of Garry’s Mod Receives DMCA on Behalf of Skibidi Toilet Creator

[Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/creator-of-garrys-mod-receives-dmca-on-behalf-of-skibidi-toilet-creator/)

Garry Newman, the creator of Garry's Mod, has received a DMCA on behalf of the SKibidi Toilet creator. The DMCA is a notice for utilizing Skibidi Toilet assets in Garry's Mod, which he is claiming to be his assets. However, most of the assets from Skibidi Toilet come from Half-Life 2, meaning that the creator of Skibidi Toilet doesn't really have a leg to stand on.
Despite the DMCA being sent on behalf of the creator, they did not approve of the DMCA or ask them to send it in the first place. "Significant revenue is being generated by unauthorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere. There is absolutely no licensed Steam, Valve, Garry's Mod content related to Skibidi Toilet." In addition to this statement, they go on to provide their Copyright Registration Number, which shows everything within the meme content that has a copyright.
This includes characters such as "Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, Titan TV Man, and Skibidi Toilet" who all have their own copyrights, giving them the rights to characters developed with Half-Life 2 assets that are owned by Valve.
It remains to be seen what will happen with this DMCA attempt going forward, as Skibidi Toilet blatantly uses Half-Life 2 assets belonging to Valve. The creator of the meme content released a small statement on their Discord server. They go on to say, "Sup y'all. Is there a way to contact Garry? I did NOT strike Garry's Mod, and I'm trying to understand what else is written in the letter!"
The company Invisible Narratives, owned by Adam Goodman and Michael Bay, created this DMCA on behalf of the creator. In recent news, this company has secured the rights to create a Skibidi Toilet movie. It remains to be seen whether this strike came as a joke or whether they were illogical when writing the letter to be sent to Garry Newman.
Whether or not Valve will get involved in this process or whether Garry Newman will make a statement on the DMCA is unknown for now. Still, it's unlikely that Invisible Narratives will have a leg to stand on, considering that the assets they use for the meme content already belong to Valve, regardless of whether they have copyright over the characters or not.
