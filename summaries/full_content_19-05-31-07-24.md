# AMD launches Ryzen 9 5900XT at $349 and Ryzen 7 5800XT at $249, AM4 platform continues into 9th year - VideoCardz.com

AMD launches Ryzen 5000XT seriesAMD launched its Ryzen brand in December 2016, and just three months later, the first Ryzen 1000 processors hit the market. At the time, probably no one expected that the platform, which started with the Bristol Ridge series, would become such a success for AMD that the company would continue to update it for the next nine years.Today, AMD is launching new processors called Ryzen 9 5900XT and Ryzen 7 5800XT, which are the latest (and most likely not the last) updates for the AM4 platform. It is unclear how many AM4 motherboards will receive updates and optimizations for these CPUs, though.Ryzen 5000XT on sale (Affiliate Links) AMD Ryzen 9 5900XT: $349 (Newegg) AMD Ryzen 7 5800XT: $249 (Newegg)The Ryzen 9 5900XT is a 16-core processor featuring a 4.8 GHz boost and a 105W TDP, which is the same core count and power configuration as the flagship Ryzen 9 5950X CPU. However, the new XT model has a 100 MHz lower boost.The Ryzen 7 5800XT is an 8-core processor with a boost up to 4.8 GHz, which is 100 MHz higher than the 5800X. For the Zen3 architecture alone, this would be the seventh SKU in the single lineup (Ryzen 5000), indicating that the 8-core configuration has become a mainstream segment for AMD.AMD has now confirmed that the Ryzen 9 5900XT will cost $349, while the 5800XT will retail at $249. Both processors are now available for purchase.AMD AM4 vs AMD AM5 Platform, Source: AMDAMD RYZEN 5000 SERIESVideoCardz.comLaunch YearSiliconCores/ThreadsBase/Boost ClockTDPiGPURyzen 9 5950X2020Vermeer16C/32T3.4/4.9 GHz105W‚ÄìRyzen 9 5900XTüÜï2024Vermeer16C/32T3.3/4.8 GHz105W‚ÄìRyzen 9 5900X2020Vermeer12C/24T3.7/4.8 GHz105W‚ÄìRyzen 9 59002021Vermeer12C/24T3.0/4.7 GHz65W‚ÄìRyzen 7 5800XTüÜï2024Vermeer8C/16T3.8/4.8 GHz105W‚ÄìRyzen 7 5800X3D2022Vermeer X3D8C/16T3.4/4.5 GHz105W‚ÄìRyzen 7 5800X2020Vermeer8C/16T3.8/4.7 GHz105W‚ÄìRyzen 7 5700X3D2024Vermeer X3D8C/16T3.0/4.1 GHz105W‚ÄìRyzen 7 5700G2021Cezanne8C/16T3.7/4.6 GHz65W8CU VegaRyzen 7 5700X2022Vermeer8C/16T3.4/4.6 GHz65W‚ÄìRyzen 7 57002023Cezanne8C/16T3.7/4.6 GHz65W‚ÄìRyzen 5 5600X3D2023Vermeer X3D6C/12T3.3/4.4 GHz105W‚ÄìRyzen 5 5600GT2024Cezanne6C/12T3.6/4.6 GHz65W7CU VegaRyzen 5 5600G2021Cezanne6C/12T3.9/4.4 GHz65W7CU VegaRyzen 5 5600X2020Vermeer6C/12T3.7/4.6 GHz65W‚ÄìRyzen 5 56002022Vermeer6C/12T3.5/4.4 GHz65W‚ÄìRyzen 5 5500GT2024Cezanne6C/12T3.6/4.4 GHz65W6CU VegaRyzen 5 55002022Cezanne6C/12T3.6/4.2 GHz65W‚ÄìRyzen 3 5300G2021Cezanne4C/8T4.0/4.2 GHz65W6CU Vega
